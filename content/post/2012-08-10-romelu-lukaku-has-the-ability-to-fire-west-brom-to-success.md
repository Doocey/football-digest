I must say I'm quite surprised by this move.   
Romelu Lukaku, lured from Belgium for a reported fee of Â£18m just last summer, hasn't really had much playing time in a Chelsea shirt and this move to West Brom should provide him with regular Premier League football. A very physical, and commanding CF; Lukaku will prove a real bundle for any opposition this season. Fulham were looking to land the 19 year-old but West Brom have managed to get a deal over the line to mark a fantastic piece of business by Steve Clarke.Â   
The Belgian will no doubt - providing <!--more--> he gets appropriate service - fire West Brom up the table and they could well exceed expectations if they can play him to his strengths.Â 

He's perhaps someone Newcastle United could have done with as he's not entirely different to a certain Andy Carroll. He is stronger, and more powerful - but they're both equally lethal in the air.  
However, it seems like Lukaku only had eyes for West Brom and no doubt West Brom manager Steve Clarke was spoken of in high regard by the Chelsea staff.

A move to the Baggies made sense for all parties concerned.

I'm sure there was a fee involved, but considering his age and the relations between Clarke and Chelsea - the fee was probably minimal.

I think they've pulled a bit of a masterstroke with this signing, but of course only time will tell.  
Don't be surprised to see this guy hit double figures with the likes of Chris Brunt firing balls into him.

Exciting times for West Brom supporters!

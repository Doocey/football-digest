Well, our first post eh? Not much on the site I know but we’re only new! Anyway, in a nut shell we plan to bring you the most important football news that you need to know without the usual nonsensical headlines.

On here you should be greeted with a very clean site design, free from poker site pop-ups and most of the other advertisements that can annoy the hell out of anyone! We love everything football and since you’re reading this – we’ve a feeling you do too.

From detailed game analysis, match previews, to opinion pieces; we hope to make Football Digest a bookmark on your computer. Everything from  the articles, to the site layout we’ve done ourselves so you can be sure that everything you’ll find on here is most certainly ours.

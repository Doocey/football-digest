It's that stage of the season again. Your Fantasy League team is either - in my case - trailing behind your mate's teams, or if you're one of the lucky ones, you are looking to pull away at the top of the table. We have just entered February, the month where Fantasy Football business well and truly enters the final straight. Who do you choose to captain your team? Who do you trust between the sticks to keep a clean sheet and pull off a few saves? Indeed, who do you slot in midfield with the expectancy they will goal creator for your forwards? What player can you pick that will gain you valuable points that your rivals won't? And no, Shola Ameobi is not the right answer to that question.

In a new segment here at Football Digest, we are going to give you four tips every weekend from now until the end of the season to help you progress up that fantasy league table and earn the bragging rights at your school, college, or work place. Obviously our tips/picks are not bankers nor do they constitute a guaranteed 10 point haul each week, however, they will be players we think could well have a stellar weekend in the Premier League.

**Fixtures:**

Queens Park Rangers Norwich City   
Arsenal v Stoke City   
Wigan v Southampton   
Newcastle United v Chelsea   
West Ham v Swansea   
Everton v Aston Villa   
Fulham v Manchester United   
West Brom v Tottenham Htspr   
Manchester City v Liverpool

Rather than waste time in discussing candidates, we'll get straight to our picks for this weekend, with an accompanying reason as to why he might be a decent pick.

**Pick 1:**

**Tim Howard:** At home to Aston Villa, Everton really should dispose of the Villans comfortably. Although Paul Lambert's side showed some positives in their second half performance at home to Newcastle United, Everton should still prevail. I can't see Villa scoring at Goodison, and Howard is a decent shout for a clean sheet. If you currently have Cech, drop him and grab £5.5m Tim Howard instead.

**Pick 2:**

**Sylvain Distin:** Before you ask, no, I'm not an Everton fan. However, I just really fancy the Toffee's chances at home to Villa tomorrow. Everton are pushing for a Top 4 finish this season and Moyes knows games such as these are three points that should not be passed on. Distin will play the 90, costs a mere £5.3m, poses a threat from corners, and there is a good chance he'll keep a clean sheet.

**Pick 3:**

**Theo Walcott:** If you don't already have the tricky little Englishman, then now is the time to get him. Arsenal face a slow Stoke City side at a packed out Emirates, there can only be only result you'd imagine. With Cazorla prodding balls beyond Shawcross, it will be difficult to contain Theo for the full 90 minutes. At £9.4m he is expensive, but worth the investment as next up after Stoke is Sunderland.

**Pick 4:**

**Carlos Tevez:** While it is tempting to stick another Everton player/Olivier Giroud here, I've opted for the combative Argentine. Liverpool showed they were no pushovers at the Emirates a few days ago, but Tevez has the ability to grab a couple against them if he shows up. With his driving runs and good movement, he'll likely be presented with a chance or two, or at the least, provide an assist. £8.9m too, ain't bad.


So there we have it. Four picks, four potential points earners. Saying that, all of those players have the potential to get sent off, concede three goals, and have an absolute howler. That is the beauty of the fantasy league.

If things go to plan, Tevez will nick a couple of goals, Howard & Distin will keep clean sheets, and Theo Walcott will score a brace, while providing a couple of assists for Olivier Giroud.

Hardly too much to ask, is it?!

![Arjen Robben in action for Bayern Munich](/uploads/2013/05/Arjen-Robben-FC-Bayern.jpg)

It was almost written in the script that Bayern would avenge the memories of last year's defeat to Chelsea in suiting fashion. A certain Arjen Robben obliged when - with one minute left on the clock - the Dutchman weaved his way into the Dotmund box before nudging the ball beyond a despairing Weidenfeller to finally capture the Champions League trophy for the Bavarian outfit. However, their victory was nothing near a classic, or even in any way convincing. In the first half Borussia could have been heading into half-time with a 3-1 lead only for some fine keeping from Manuel Neuer.

The Bundesliga champions looked second class for the majority of the first 45 minutes; nervous, edgy throughout. Borussia on the other hand seemed confident and well versed in what they had to do throughout the ninety minutes. Their tactics worked for the majority of the game, hampering Schweinsteiger's freedom and in turn forcing the German to drop much deeper than he would have liked in a Champions League final.

Lewandowski was unstoppable during the first half, Boateng unable to mark the Pole and to be completely honest, the in-demand forward could have nabbed himself a couple of goals before Wembley descending into the interval. Neuer was on-form twice to deny him, indeed to save from Lewandowski and then B?aszczykowski who had a right footed volley palmed to safety.

The second half saw Bayern introduce themselves a little more - the champions forced play and picked out a lively Robben at every opportunity. The Dutchman had various chances to in both halves to get his name on the score-sheet but seemed immune to trying anything on his right foot (hardly surprising).

Then came the opener - Mario Mandžuki? on hand to edge home from two yards out after the Borussia defence was caught sleeping. 8 minutes later the equaliser came, Dante who was already booked for an earlier challenge collided with Reus, and Gundogan stepped up to beautifully slot home to restore parity between the sides.

When one considers the challenges that occured in the game, it is shocking to think not one Bayern player was not sent off. Franck Ribery lashed out at Lewandowski early in the first half in a move that would probably have merited a yellow card at the very least in any other circumstance besides a Champions League final. Then Dante, who gave away the penalty with a brainless challenge should have been shown a second yellow, after receiving one earlier in the match. In other words, Bayern were very lucky to have 11 men for the entire game.

Eventually, in heartbreaking fashion for BVB supporters, a long ball lofted forward from the Bayern half fell into the path of Robben and he coolly slotted home the decider.

From watching that game last night, it really makes me wonder how there was 20+ points between these two sides in the league. I'll admit I do not watch Bayern or Borussia week-in week-out, but the tags that people are attributing to Bayern such as 'best team in the world' do not register with me. Fair enough they have a good team, with individuals who can change a game at any given moment. They have a solid defence for sure, but if they had been playing Manchester United/Chelsea and perhaps even Arsenal in that Champions League final last night - I'm not so sure Jupp Heynckes would be celebrating a going away present.

Just my thoughts, but with Guardiola set to arrive at Allianz Arena, I look forward to Bayern proving me wrong.

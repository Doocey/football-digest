If there is one thing any neutral supporter, or indeed Liverpool fan learned from today's draw with Sunderland - it's that Brendan Rodgers has a _real_ job on his hands.  
I ended up watching this evenings game as it was the only thing on TV. My word, what a shocking game it was. Both sides were truly dreadful. For anyone who didn't actually see the game; don't be fooled by the fact there were a couple of goals.   
Never have I seen a Liverpool side lacking so much in conviction, and penetration. Gerrard looked rusty to put it mildly while Allen was quite frankly anonymous for the <!--more--> entire game. Only Glen Johnson, who ventured forward every now and again, looked anyways dangerous to a back four that - at one stage - accommodated a certain Titus Bramble.

Sunderland on the other hand were just as bad.   
Sessegnon tried to spark things in favour of Martin O'Neill's men, but couldn't really get anything going at the end of the day. McClean was nowhere to be seen for the full match while Fletcher fed off scraps and thankfully for SAFC - buried (if I remember correctly) his only chance of the game. That's what you pay Â£14m for, [as I mentioned before he signed][1]: he's a goalscorer.

Regardless of Sunderland and their sluggish start - they've still managed to go without a loss and are adding points to the board. Liverpool have started with two losses & a draw and today's result marked only their second point on the Barclays Premier League table. Terrible.

What I really cannot understand however, isn't why they're not picking up wins, or playing as fluidly as Rodgers' Swansea City did.  
I realise that the team itself will need at least a dozen games before they can play with a relative amount of mutual understanding, especially between the likes of Allen, Suarez, Sterling, Borini etc.

I just can't figure out how Liverpool messed up _so badly_ in the transfer window on all fronts.   
They let Kuyt go and then ridiculously let Andy Carroll out on loan to West Ham without bringing a striker in as his replacement.

Clint Dempsey was link intensively with LFC throughout the window and it looked like a deal wasn't far away only for Fulham to reject their bid, and instead accept an approach from Andre Villas Boas and Tottenham Hotspur. The window slammed shut and Liverpool were left high and dry. Forget about bringing in Borini or Assaidi - they simply didn't sign a striker that'll score you goals.

Fair enough Rodgers has/had no plans for the towering Andy Carroll, but the way in which he treated him was nothing less than pathetic. Carroll is the type of player that will guarantee you goals if you play him to his strengths, something Liverpool didn't really try since his Â£35m move from Tyneside. Buy why shaft him out of a chance with LFC before even giving him a go?

With all that said, how did Liverpool actually end up in such a hole? Surely if Dempsey was their primary target in the window they would have allocated the Andy Carroll loan fee money towards agreeing a fee with Fulham for the American? At such a level of football, these novice mistakes have cost sides in the past and could well cost LFC again.

If Suarez gets injured who do Liverpool turn to?

What I've gathered from the first few games this season is that they are already depending a tad too much (particularly today) on Raheem Sterling and him exposing the opposition LB. At 17, the lad needs to learn from others and despite the saying 'if you're good enough, you're old enough' he needs a lot of tuition before he is ready for constant first team action.

Anyway, with all the aforementioned taken into account, I want to know what you, supporters of Liverpool, make of the whole situation with Rodgers, LFC and that void up front at Anfield?

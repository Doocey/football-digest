Optimism is a great thing. Realism is quite another.  
When Manchester United were drawn against Real Madrid in the first knockout stage of the Champions League, everyone's mind wandered to Cristiano Ronaldo and his imminent return to Old Trafford, indeed his first return since departing in the summer of 2009. The stylish magician would - in March - reenter the &#8216;cathedral' that helped him on his way to becoming one of the best footballers in the world. Old Trafford is the place where he made a name for himself. In fact, Old Trafford could be where the Portuguese maestro helps eliminate <!--more--> his former employers, as Mourinho continues his quest for a Champions League trophy with Real Madrid.

While most Manchester United will deem this the dream tie, the 2011/12 Premier League runners up really couldn't have wished for worse opposition. It was hardly a shock however, as this pairing had a certain inevitability about it since both teams confirmed their progression to the next round almost a month ago.

As a neutral it is difficult to see where United can turn the tie in their favour. Whatever chance they stand, a home victory is imperative. However, even if they are to secure victory at home to the GalÃ¡cticos, can they amass such a goal difference to ensure they creep into the latter stages of the competition? I think not.

Going to the BernabÃ©u is no easy feat, far from it. You know what will greet you once you step onto the pitch, aÂ forayÂ of lighting quick movement a defensive solidity that would appear as if it could keep anything from breaching its rearguard. Of course, one of the reasons we love the Champions League is because it can offer us the unexpected and gives the underdog the chance to upstage their supposed 'superiors'.

I would expect a comfortable 2-0 win for the Spaniards at home to Fergie's men, but if United can score and not concede too many then they might just stand a chance of ending Mourinho's spell in the competition. It is, however, a major 'if'.

Compare the back four of each team and there is only one winner.   
Compare the midfield, again, Real triumph.   
Compare the forward lines and as unit, Real take the spoils.  
RVP and Rooney will need to produce something quite special if they are to disrupt the efforts of Ronaldo, Benzema, and Ozil. I'm not saying it's impossible and if any team can do exactly that, then it most certainly is Manchester United, however, I think this tie will suit Real much more than it'll sit with Rio Ferdinand and co.

It won't be a walkover, but I expect a comfortable and professional performance from Real at home, then an organised defensive masterclass in the return leg.

**Prediction:**   
Real Madrid 2-0 Manchester United  
Manchester United 0-0 Real Madrid

What are your predictions?Â Can United triumph throughout the two legs?

Following the signings of Romain Amalfitano and Gael Bigirimana, Alan Pardew is closing in on his number one target this summer: Mathieu Debuchy. You might recognise Debuchy from Euro 2012 where alongside his future teammate, Yohan Cabaye, he featured as France's most notable performer in what was a lackluster tournament for Laurent Blanc's men.   
After prolonged discussions and various failed bids - Newcastle United finally agreed a deal for Debuchy which will see the right-back join on a 4 year deal, for a fee in the region of £7m. The signing indirectly marks an end to Danny <!--more--> Simpson's Newcastle United career as he is expected to join newly promoted Reading in the coming week.

Newcastle United fans (including myself) will be relieved to get the deal over the line finally, after Inter Milan tried their utmost to lure to the Frenchman to the San Siro. However, Yohan Cabaye's friendship turned invaluable in securing a deal, and convincing Debuchy - who made the Ligue 1 team of the year this season - that Newcastle United was the right place to progress his career.

With Steven Taylor regaining fitness by the day, a back four including Debuchy, Coloccini, and Davide Santon is very pleasing to the eye of any NUFC fan. On paper at least, it has the makings of a very solid and tight defence and with a very good midfield & forwardline in front of them - it really is exciting times for any Geordie.

Of course there is always the possibility of Mike Ashley selling a key man and disrupting the rhythm in the side, but so far Pardew's signings have been done on the quiet, and seem like exciting prospects. The best thing about it all is the fact that the money we are spending on Debuchy is still part of the Andy Carroll sum, and there's more money there for any other potential signings.

NUFC's £11m bid for Luuk de Jong highlighted the fact that there is indeed cash available for the right player. The £7m capture of Mathieu Debuchy quite clearly shows that Mike Ashley, Graham Carr (head scout) and the manager all agree that he is the ideal player and would be a perfect addition to an already large French contingent on Tyneside.

Alan Pardew, or should that be Alan Pardeaux?! will be happy to get his #1 man in a Black and White shirt as pre-season just begins. Keep an eye out for Debuchy in the Premier League this season - although he isn't an official NUFC player yet, he will be in the next couple of days!

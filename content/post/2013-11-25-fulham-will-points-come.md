When the Premier League creeps closer to the month of December fans of the most entertaining league in the world can usually grasp an idea of the likely relegation candidates. Last season Queens Park Rangers gave the impression of a relegated side from the minute the Premier League began - in fact I favoured such a possibility during the summer when their recruitment went into overdrive, an article that didn't go down too well with the QPR faithful!  
Sometimes the majority of EPL fans can see a side that is clearly not cut out for the standard of the league, and early signs this season would point at Crystal Palace, although their win over Hull City at the weekend is cause for hope, for Eagles fans across the world.

Another side who strike me as a struggling outfit are Martin Jol's Fulham. Last season they managed to scrape clear of the dreaded relegation zone and secure safety but in a summer when the club should have added strength and depth to their squad - they could only manage to lure Darren Bent from Aston Villa on loan to aid their forward line.

That feeling of a lack of progress is well-known to myself as a Newcastle United fan, and last season was one to forget for Alan Pardew's men too as his French legion just managed to avoid relegation by the skin of their teeth. Bent happened to be a summer target for us as well, but he ended up at Craven Cottage while we opted for Loic Remy instead, not a bad decision looking back at it!

On Saturday last Fulham suffered yet another home defeat, falling to a Swansea City side who have not enjoyed the best start to a Premier League campaign themselves. Jonjo Shelvey secured all three points for the traveling Swans, while Martin Jol's men were forced to remain in the bottom three.

Quite a basic rule of thumb in football is if you happen to have played more games then you have points - then there is a problem, a rather large one indeed. **Fulham** have amassed 10 points from 12 games, and their fixture list isn't getting any easier as the highly anticipated action packed Christmas period approaches.

The arrival of Rene Meulesteen is a positive move by the hierarchy as the ex-United coach has that winning mentality and grit that came with years of service to Alex Ferguson. If the London outfit are to remain in the Premier League, then you can be sure that Rene will have a huge part to play in the mission.

There is cause for hope at Craven Cottage though, and the performances against Swansea City on Saturday was not one of their worst. In fact, on account of the post - Fulham may well have snatched all three points with Darren Bent's rasping attempt.

My concerns though lie with their actual playing squad. A forward line of Darren Bent and the mercurial Dimitar Berbatov supported by a midfield of Adel Taarabt, Steve Sidwell, and Scott Parker does not inspire great attacking prowess, and one has to question whether quite a few of the Fulham squad have the legs to put together a solid string of form to lift them away from the relegation zone.

**Darren Bent** is a natural finisher and is an almost cast-iron guarantee of goals _if he has the service_. Bryan Ruiz is another extremely talented footballer if given the right role and a certain freedom to roam across the park.

With West Ham, Tottenham, Aston Villa, and Everton all awaiting Fulham in the next four fixtures - one has to ask where will the points come from to shape a better looking Premier League table for Jol's men come the New Year?

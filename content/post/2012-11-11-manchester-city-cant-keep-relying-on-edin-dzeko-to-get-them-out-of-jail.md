To say Eden Džeko is becoming a bit of a 'super-sub' would be a slight understatement. Yet again the powerful Bosnian showed up with at the death, to ensure an extremely important 3 points for Manchester City, and stake yet another claim for a starting role at the Etihad.  
It seems this season that Manchester City must concede before they actually start playing football.   
Steven Caulker found himself on the end of Tom Huddlestone free-kick to head the visitors in front, and they held that leads to the latter stages of the game. Sergio Aguero popped up with a delightful finish to even things up, and on the 88th minute, Dzeko thumped one into the roof of the net to make it two straight defeats for Andre Villas-Boas.

However, I think there might be a much more underlying problem at the Ethihad. Manchester City, at least from most of the games I've seen this season, has been OK, nothing special. Saying that, they have picked up a lot of wins, and have come from behind to secure a victory, in the style of champions.

However, when City are poor, they're **very poor.** Away at West Ham a week ago they were bereft of creativity and Mancini insisted in taking off Carlos Tevez who looked like the only danger to a comfortable West Ham defence that evening. He placed Carlos with Javi Garcia too, which is probably a bit questionable to say the least.

A week earlier they just about ousted Swansea City at home in a less than perfect performance. A win is a win indeed, but any City fan would be hoping that their side is a little more convincing in front of goal.

Two late goals from Dzeko away at West Brom one week previous to the Swansea result saved them from a poor defeat, and again today the Bosnian popped up win the decisive goal. But, just how much longer can this go on? How much longer can Dzeko keep saving his side from dropping points?

I'm sure a lot of you will remember the final day of the season when Manchester City looked as if they had gifted the title to their rivals Manchester United, only to mount a comeback in injury time. Eden Dzeko also appeared with a header in that game to ensure a thrilling final couple of minutes, but the game should never have come to that. Queens Park Rangers at home should have an easy three points regardless of what stage of the season it is, but City love to makes things hard for themselves.

While it may seem like I am making a strong case for Dzeko to be handed a regular starting role at Manchester City(!), the actual point I am trying to convey in this article is that Mancini's side are playing a dangerous game, and they might face huge difficulty in retaining the Premier League title this season.

Manchester United will be consistent all season, and they'll be snapping right at the heels of Kompany's side.   
There is only so many times you'll be able to rescue a game at the death, and City's pot of luck is becoming lighter each and every week.

They need to show consistency on the pitch week in week out, and they have no excuses considering the squad they possess.   
Tactically they are questionable at times, but who knows - maybe City will make life a little easier for themselves over the Christmas period by actually scoring first and taking the pressure off.

Time will tell whether MCFC have what it takes both mentally and physically, to retain the Premier League title. As of now, I fancy Rooney and co. to grab it back.

Comments welcome.

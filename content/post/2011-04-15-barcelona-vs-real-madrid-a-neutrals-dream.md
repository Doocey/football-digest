It is a tie we perhaps somewhat expected to arise at some stage in the UEFA Champions League but it is now reality. After dispensing of Tottenham in a 5-0 aggregateÂ scoreline; Real Madrid will find only Barcelona - their nearest rivals - standing between then and another Champions League title for Jose Mourinho. It is a tantalizing tie no doubt but who will progress is the most important question being asked.

It really is a dream tie for the neutral fan as the title suggests. We will look forward to seeing Ronaldo strut his stuff for Madrid, whilst their defence will try contain the best player in the world: Lionel Messi.

Inter Milan are the reigning champions but their crown will be removed in Wembley come May after the crashed out in humiliating circumstances to Schalke 04.

Who do you expect to win the affair? Who will take on a probable Manchester United side in their back garden?

We here at FootballDigest believe that Barcelona will progress - in a well fought encounter.

Real know what is at stake, Mourinho above anyone else. He would love nothing more than to manage two different sides to the same prestigious title in quick succession. Should he manage it; he really would be the Special One.

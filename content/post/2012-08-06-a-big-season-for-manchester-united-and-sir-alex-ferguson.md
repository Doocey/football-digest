When Sergio AgÃ¼ero smashed home _that_ goal in the 94th minute at the Etihad on the final day of the season, it sent a message to all associated with Manchester United that City - their biggest rivals - meant business.Â   
Finally, after years of watching their neighbours enjoy incredible success in almost every club competition, City themselves had managed to capture the league trophy in the most dramatic of finishes I've ever had the pleasure of watching. As the 2012/13 Premier League approaches, Mancini and MCFC will be hoping to retain the title while also attempting <!--more--> to bring the coveted Champions League trophy to the Blueside of Manchester.

While City haven't really strengthened their squad by any significant means just yet, there is plenty of time for the Italian to add a face or two to an already impressive bunch of players.   
Sir Alex Ferguson on the otherhand has managed to land a couple of players already, in Shinji Kagawa and Nick Powell.Â 

In in the last day or so, they were closing in on the highly rated Brazilian, Lucas Moura, which would be a brilliant signing by the Scot, and would also send out a strong signal of intent that United are raring to claim back the league title.

The forthcoming season is one of huge significance to Manchester United. For obvious reasons, winning back the title would be fantastic, but to grab the trophy out of Manchester City's hands would be even sweeter. A lot of people are predicting that City will retain the title, but I have a feeling, and I hope, that Sir Alex Ferguson will be the one with the elusive silverware at the end of the season.

City's wild spending helped them to the title last season, but to be fair, it took absolute guts, grit and determination to come back against QPR and win it the way they did. For that, they deserve immense credit. However, despite the fact that United cannot seemingly compete with City's spending, they still have the quality to oust opposition and make the 2012/13 Premier League theirs.

If City are to go on and retain it, as football goes, Alex Ferguson might consider his position as manager of the great club, but should he manage to bring the trophy back to the Red part of Manchester - I can only assume it would be well up there with his finest title wins.  
(Of course, there's no need to remind me of the mid 90's when my own NUFC blew a huge lead at Christmas to hand Alex the league!)Â 

Every season is a big season, but once things kick off in just a few weeks time, both City and Manchester United will be entering unknown territory. It really is an extremely important season for both sides to say the least.Â 

For any United fans out there, should Ferguson manage to bring home the title yet again, do you think he would call it a day?Â Trumping City to the trophy this season would be a pretty special way to bow out, wouldn't it?..

Comments welcome, as always ðŸ™‚Â

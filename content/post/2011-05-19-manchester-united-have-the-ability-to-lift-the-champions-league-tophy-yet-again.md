![Alex Ferguson watches United in action against Everton](http://www.footballdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Alex-Ferguson.jpg)

This Champions League Final is the same match up as two years ago; a tie which Barcelona won comfortably courtesy of Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi. The real thing I can remember from that game was Messi's expert header, a real piece of genius from such a small man. However, I can't see it being the same sort of scoreline this time around.

Everyone fancies Barcelona to cruise to victory in the 90 minutes here, and they are as low as 1/2 in places to do exactly that. I think Manchester United will have something to say about that; and with a new frontman in the form of Chicharito Hernandez - we could have a very intriguing game in the making.

I do expect an open game, but one United will control. I believe they have enough quality to keep the ball off Barcelona, and have them chase it - something the Catalans have becoming reknowned for in the last couple of years. (Passing, not chasing!)

Alex Ferguson is a far more experienced manager than Pep Guardiola and experience means a whole lot when it comes to prestigious tournaments like this.

SAF has seen it all, and has won more Champions Leagues than quite a few other managers in the world, including Pep of course.

I don't want to bore you and get deep into possible set-plays, key battles or where the game will be won or lost but what I can tell you is: Manchester United will not lay down when Wembley comes.

I think they can win it yet again, and it's my opinion that they will.

Some gloss might well be taken off Barcelona's season if they lose this, but only time can tell.

I just know who I will be backing in the local..

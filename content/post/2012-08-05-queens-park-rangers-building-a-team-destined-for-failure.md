To say QPR avoided relegation by the skin of their teeth on the final day of the season, would be putting it lightly.   
At one stage in their last game, they were losing away to a title bound Manchester City, while the other side attempting to avoid relegation, Bolton Wanderers were winning away at Stoke City.  
If things stayed the same way, QPR would have been relegated, but to the astonishment of every football fan in England, Mark Hughes' side at point in the game took a 2-1 lead, only for City - with the title on the line - to score <!--more--> two last-minute goals.

It didn't matter however, as Stoke City had pegged Owen Coyle's Bolton back, and sent the Trotters tumbling into the nPower Championship.

Staying in the Premier League helped the London side - owner by airline tycoon Tony Fernandes - avoid financial disaster. If it had been Queens Park Rangers relegated rather than Bolton, the scary fact is that none of their 'star' players would have been forced to take wage cuts. The financial implications can only be left to the imagination.

Now, as Mark Hughes looks to build for the future, he has already secured an array of players that he hopes will fire QPR to a respectable finish in the Premier League this forthcoming season.   
Andy Johnson, Ryan Nelsen, Rob Green, Samba Diakite, Junior Hoilett, and Park Ji-Sung have all signed the dotted line at Loftus Road in the last month with Hoilett, the most notable of arrivals.

The likes of Park, Nelsen, Johnson and Green are all well into their thirties and their best footballing days are _well_ and truly behind them at this stage. Johnson is injury prone and likely to spend some period of the upcoming season on the sidelines, while Nelsen and Park haven't played prolonged first team football in quite a while.   
It really doesn't make for good reading for QPR fans, at least, in my opinion.

As a Newcastle United fan, I know what it's like to sign overaged, and overpaid players - it just doesn't work and ever since we incorporated a new transfer policy at St.James' Park where only players aged 26 and younger could be signed; the club has enjoyed a remarkable two years.

With QPR, what Mark Hughes is building, is a side that will be fighting relegation at the end of the season. They already have the likes of Bobby Zamora, and Joey Barton who take home some ridiculous wages each week, for very average footballers.  
The signing of Junior Hoilett is impressive, but he's reported to be earning Â£70,000 a week. Seventy thousand a week for a guy that was part of a Blackburn side that had a miserable Premier League campaign last season, and suffered relegation? Daftness.

It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.   
QPR are going down a road that from my experience, only ends in one thing: failure.

The implications of failure at Loftus Road are as scary as things can get. For fans of the age-old club I hope that they can avoid relegation again this season, however, those signings wouldn't fill me with an awful lot of confidence.

A team destined for failure? Perhaps.

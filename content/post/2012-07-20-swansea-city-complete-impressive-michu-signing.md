While Gylfi Sigurdsson may have opted to sign for Andre Villas Boas's Tottenham, and despite the fact Joe Allen looks likely to link up with Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool; there is good news for Swansea fans across the globe.  
After agreeing a fee of £2m, Michael Laudrup today completed the signing of Rayo Vallecano's attacking midfielder Michu. The Spaniard signed a three year deal, and after an excellent 15 goals last season for a side that escaped the drop on the final day of the season in the La Liga, this signing is nothing less than an absolute bargain. Michu becomes <!--more--> Laudrup's third signing after taking over at the Liberty Stadium following Brendan Rodger's move departure to Liverpool, with de Guzman and Chico already in the bag. 

Swansea City were certainly the surprise package of the newly promoted teams in the Premier League last season, with Rodger's move to Liverpool proving that the Swans made quite the impression in the top flight.

Newly appointed Laudrup will hope to avoid second season syndrome with Swansea, and indeed keep them in the Premier League for years to come. The signing of Michu will certainly come to the surprise and delight of their fans, as the attacking midfielder will provide pace, and a goals in what will be a challenging second season.

Even with the seemingly imminent departure of Joe Allen, there's definitely optimism at the Liberty Stadium with both recent signings, and management appointments. Relegation shouldn't be an issue if everything goes smoothly for Huw Jenkins men.

Comments welcome folks!

When Demba Ba hit double figures extremely early on in the Premier League last season, people immediately began to ponder where the Senegalese forward would be playing his football in 2012, they certainly didn't expect it to be St.James' Park. These are the same people who said NUFC would fade away from the Top 6 in the New Year.  
However, despite constant rumours and the best efforts of the London media; Demba Ba's much publicised £7.5m release clause will expire at midnight, tonight. Unless some club makes a quick move to offer the cash, and <!--more--> agree unarguably intricate terms - Demba Ba will be wearing Black and White next season. You'd have to say Newcastle United have done very well indeed.

This is a guy who managed almost 20 goals in his first full Premier League season, with a side that were facing their second season following promotion from the npower Championship. Demba made hitting the back of the net look extremely easy, and only for the arrival of his friend - Pappiss Cissé - Ba would have most definitely reached the twenty goal milestone.

He was deployed on the left-wing for the most of 2012, and was involved in a lot of Papiss' goals. His trojan work down the wing, linking up with Jonas, and even Ben Arfa helped Newcastle United secure a remarkable 5th placed finish. Remember, Ba was Andy Carroll's replacement and he arrived on a free from the, then relegated West Ham. Bit of a bargain, eh?

As the clock ticks towards midnight, NUFC fans will be delighted in knowing that if Ba _is_ to leave this summer, it won't be for a measly seven and half million pounds.

But, the fact that no team decided to trigger his release clause almost certainly indicates that he'll be a Newcastle player for the season to come - it wouldn't be great business paying double for him in a few weeks, after opting against activating his release clause. Would it?!

Personally, I don't think Demba did want to leave, and even if the lure of a Champions League club may have turned him to the exit - it seems no club of that calibre, or indeed **any** club came calling for the #19, since the window opened.

For NUFC, it's one key player that won't be leaving, or on the cheap at least, and now their pursuit of Andy Carroll either ceases, or moves forward. Which one will it be?

Will Ashley still look to land the £35m man, or will he count his change and offer that little bit more to finally push the Mathieu Debuchy deal over the line? The second option has to be a no brainer, surely?

Comments welcome folks!

![Lionel Messi in action for Barcelona at Camp Nou](http://www.footballdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Lionel-Messi-Barcelona.jpg)

Barcelona may wellÂ haveÂ the league title wrapped up in cotton wool, but their Champions League hopes hang by a thread following a 2-0 defeat away at AC Milan a week ago. The Italians head into the return leg next week with an unlikely two goal advantage, and will hoping to see out a Barcelona onslaught at the Nou Camp in under a weeks time. A lot of people claim that the Barcelona of 2012/13 are not quite as good as their team the year previous but the performances of Lionel Messi have been nothing short of majestic, notching up 39 goals in the La Liga alone, with a real chance of hitting the <!--more--> 50 league goal mark this season.

However, silky Barcelona and their plans to capture the Champions League trophy hit somewhat of a snag when Kevin Prince Boetang smashed home the opening goal in the San Siro Stadium, after a blatant hand ball (what is with dodgy CL decisions this year?!).

Sulley Muntari swept home the Italian side's second goal of the night after some fine football, and when the final whistle sounded at a packed out theatre, Barcelona knew that it would take something quite special to get a hand back on the elusive trophy that currently resides in London.

Unlike a lot of other teams in the world though, Barcelona _do_ special.

When the two teams lock horns in the second leg on the 12th - do not be surprised to see the Catalans turn in a world class display, indeed a display that will merit two early goals, and perhaps even finish the Italians in normal time.

Lionel MessiÂ admitted yesterdayÂ that he is 'hurting' from Barcelona's current form, and let's be honest, who wants to play against a wounded LM? If Milan are to progress to the next round of the Champions League, then they're going to have to take a large gamble at Nou Camp to try and score.

The La Liga champions in waiting willÂ undoubtedlyÂ control over 60% of possession for the entire ninety minutes and Milan will be forced to do a lot of running which will result in tired legs sooner rather than later. The Spaniards are likely to exploit this as they've done countless time in the past and we might see a few goals.

If I was to make a prediction, I think it'll be 2-0 at half-time to the home side.Â   
Rossoneri will go into the game in good spirits and with a very good lead, but I can't help and think Messi will turn the tie around in his side's favour. Then again, I could be wrong.

What do you folk think - will Milan pull off a masterclass in containment, or will Barca's movement and fluid movement prove too much?

![Romelu Lukaku celebrates after scoring for Manchester United](/images/romelu-lukaku-manchester-united.jpg)

**Romelu Lukaku** has thanked his 'real' fans on social media after he scored a brace in Belgium's 3-3 draw with Mexico.

The 24-year-old has been at the centre of attention surrounding the Red Devils recently, with fans creating a controversial song for their £76m summer signing that has since been banned.

Jose Mourinho has personally defended the former Everton striker on a number of occasions in recent weeks, stating that the striker was 'untouchable in my team.'
However, there still seems to be tension between the Red Devils fans and the Belgian international.

Lukaku wrote on his Instagram page:

> _'Big thank you to all my teammates and the real fans out there for the messages! @belgianreddevils'_

Lukaku has netted seven goals in the [Premier League](http://footballweeks.com/category/premier-league/) since his big-money move to Old Trafford over the summer. However, he hasn't found the back of the net in the Premier League since a 4-0 victory over Crystal Palace in September.
Man United host Newcastle when the international break ends and the Belgian forward will be desperate to replicate his previous form in securing all three points against Rafa Benitez's side.

Lukaku is expected to be a front runner in the race for the Premier League golden boot this season, along with Manchester City's **Sergio Aguero**, Tottenham Hotspur star Harry Kane and Chelsea new-boy Alvaro Morata.
[Elsewhere](http://manuniteddevils.com/man-united-ready-pay-177m-sign-marco-asensio/), Manchester United are reportedly considering set to pay £177m to secure the signing of Real Madrid starlet **Marco Asensio**, according to Spanish rumour publication Don Balon via Man United Devils.

The 21-year-old has seen stock risen rapidly to the top of European football [following his £3m move to Real Madrid](http://kwese.espn.com/football/league-name/story/2181088/headline) in 2014. Asensio has notched 56 appearances for the European and La Liga champions, netting 17 goals followed by six brilliant assists.

Asensio's incredible performances for Spain in the U21 European Championship during the the summer helped rise him to the top, whilst also continuing his superb performances in both legs of the Supercopa de España against Barcelona at the beginning of the season.

Before anyone comments; I know Wolves have been relegated to the npower Championship, and that technically, Steven Fletcher is no longer a Premier League striker.  
However, that will change before the summer transfer window closes on September the 1st, with Sunderland looking to spend a sizeable £14m on the former Burnley man.   
In the last few days, many Sunderland fans have expressed their dismay at the reported fee of £14m, and the majority of neutral fans believe that Martin O'Neill is paying over the odds. SAFC fans would have expected the signing <!--more--> of Fletcher to be a very straight forward matter as in most cases, relegated clubs have to sell their key men in order to prepare their club for the coming season.

However, the Scots' saga has drawn on for the last few weeks as the Wolves board continue to rejected the Black Cats advances. It seems only a fee close to £15m will finally persuade the relegated outfit to part with their leading striker, who scored an impressive 12 goals in what was an extremely underwhelming 2011/12 Premier League campaign for the West Midlands side.

As a NUFC fan, I like to think I'm quite fair in my analysis of other footballing matters, and when it comes to Fletcher - I think he's extremely underrated. In fact, maybe even the most underrated CF in the Premier League (when he plays in it).

Realistically, he is far too good for the Championship and in the last few days, he has made it known that he wants a move away from Molineux. A transfer request has been handed in, yet despite this, Sunderland have had three bids rejected.   
For a side who finished 13th in the league last season - below two of the three newly promoted sides - £14m is a lot of money to spend.

With that said, one could spend £14m or even more, on a less desirable player. David Bentley anyone?

Any time I've watched Fletcher play, he has been fairly potent in front of goal. He makes himself a nuisance; gets himself in front of defenders, and for a guy who barely breaks 6ft - he wins a large volume of aerial challenges.

He isn't just limited to his head either, he can play, and is dangerous with the ball at his feet. (As you'd hope with a striker).

To say I rate him, would be an understatement of sorts.

That leads me to question why no other clubs have entered the running for his signature. He would suit Everton down to the ground if you ask me, or even the likes of Fulham.   
At just 25 years of age, he a Premier League striker through and through and without offending Sunderland __too much__ I think he could play at a higher level than the Stadium of Light if he wanted to.

Steven is desperate to return to the Premier League and it looks as if he'll be playing in red and white stripes next season if Martin O'Neill can get lucky with his fourth attempt. At the end of the day, a modest 'sell on percentage' that Burnley stand to collect seems to be sending the fee close to £20m, but he's British and a goalscorer so what can you expect.

He's a very good player and should do well with service from McClean and co.  
As long as he keeps quiet in the TyneWear derbies I'll be relatively happy, but if he performs to the standard I know he can, Sunderland might only be a stepping stone in an already eventful career for the Shrewsbury born forward.

Comments welcome. Sunderland fans, would you take your £14m elsewhere, or stick with Fletcher?

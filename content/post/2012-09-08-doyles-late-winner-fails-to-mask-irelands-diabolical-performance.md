When Robbie Keane slotted home an 89th minute penalty on Friday evening, there was something very reminiscent about his equaliser. Immediately most Irish fans thought of Stephen Ireland's late goal away against San Marino four years ago - a goal that saved our embarrassment until the next fixture.  
The smash and grab in Kazakhstan prevented what was going to be Ireland's most embarrassing result in more than a decade.   
No offence to Kazakhstan, but a team like Ireland should be going there and taking home three points in a less gut wrenching fashion. Personally, I only managed to <!--more--> catch the second half onwards, but for 40 minutes of that second half; Ireland were nothing short of woeful.

The lack of fluidity in the performance and the lethargic attempts at going forward didn't come as a surprise to any Ireland fan, but if the final whistle had sounded with Kazakhstan celebrating three points - there would be major calls for a new manager; a new system; a new era for Irish football.

While some of the criticism of Trapattoni has been _deferred_ for now - there's little doubt that this Ireland team is going nowhere with the Italian in charge. It pains me to say it, but it's the truth. Giovani's system is outdated and quite frankly: neither players nor the fans have any belief or interest in it.

When things are clearly going against your team, you would expect a change of mentality, and often, a change of tactics. But no, Trap elects to keep things the same and hope for the best while at the same time, playing players out of position.  
Our saving grace - Robbie Keane's penalty - was purely down to awful defending by the hosts and a bit of fortune on our side.

Saying that, Robbie took it brilliantly and adds another goal to his ridiculously impressive international scoring record.  
The winner however, came from route one stuff - but only the type of play that would work against the likes of Kazakhstan. Lump a high ball towards Stephen Ward in the box with the hope of him nodding it down to an oncoming striker against the likes of Germany and they'll clear their lines while setting up a counter attack at the same time.

In other words, if we play Germany in the same manner as we did against the Eurasia outfit - expect an overwhelming German win, and a clean sheet in the process. Sadly, it's likely that we will play the very same, unless we either get a new manager (not going to happen) or Trap decides to play his best players for a change (never going to happen).

One encouraging aspect of our result on Friday night was however, the inclusion of Wigan's James McCarthy in the first team.  
Finally he has been given his chance to impress, and although he saw more balls fly over his head than an umpire at Croke Park on a Sunday evening, at least he was there and that's all that matters. He is a very talented footballer in the right type of system, but let's be honest - with Glenn Whelan alongside, it's never going to work, not in a lifetime.

One man who didn't feature was Sunderland's James McClean and he wasn't too happy about it either - taking to Twitter to vent his frustrations about his exclusion.  
Childish and immature as ever, McClean was forced to remove the Tweet and had to issue a formal apology.

As if McClean was ever going to start - no chance. He needs to grow-up and mature before he can be a regular. If he's going to react like that every time he fails to get his way then good riddance. He's still very unproven and in my opinion - he would have done absolutely nothing against Kazakhstan. I'm sick of hearing about him to be perfectly honest.

All in all, a shocking performance on Friday night that highlights the dire straits the Irish international side are in at the moment.   
The 3 points are a welcome relief, but it purely masks (if it even manages to do that) the incompetencies that lie within the Irish squad, and management.

We need a new manager - it really is as simple as that.

Comments welcome.

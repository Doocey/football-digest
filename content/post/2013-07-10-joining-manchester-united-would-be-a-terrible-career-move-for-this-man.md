Thiago Alcantara seems to be the man on the lips of every Manchester United fan out there. His vision, passing range, general composure on the ball would give the Red Devils an overdue holding midfielder. He would be the signing to well and truly stamp David Moyes' authority on the team. Having just recently won the U21 European Championship with Spain (he scored a hattrick in the final against Italy) Thiago seems primed for a career defining decision. His rather dubious transfer clause at the Nou Camp means the technically gifted Spaniard can leave for another team for a very reasonable <!--more--> fee and United seem like they could be close to securing what would represent one of the club's biggest coups in recent years. It would be a fantastic capture for the club, for David Moyes, for the supporters - but not for Thiago himself, far from it.

**Thiago** has the ability to become one of he leading midfielders in the world - up to the standards of Xavi and Iniesta no doubt. He has every attribute to merit any trophy on earth, but he is only just turned 22. The last saga of an up and coming Spaniard departing for the Premier League at a young age that I can remember at least, was **Cesc Fabregas** move to Arsenal.

Fabregas left at 16 to join the Londoners and went on to become one of the best midfielders in the Premier League before eventually making the move back to his boyhood club three years ago. The scary fact is, if Fabregas had remained with Barcelona all that time he would now be one of the best midfielders in the world.   
As is, he is a fantastic player, but his development was hampered in England as much as it might not have shown.

How good Fabregas might have been if he had stayed with the current crop of Barcelona players - one can only leave to the imagination.

The same, could very well happen to Thiago Alcantara. This guy's development is best served with in Spain, with **Barcelona**. Moving to the Premier League with mean his would have to disregard some of the technical ability that was hammered into him at _La Masia_. He would need to adapt a more physical approach to the game - all well and good, but no need for it at just 22 years-old.

Thiago can always move to the Premier League in 6 years time when he fully accomplished. He can then take on the rigours of the Premier League and combine his technical ability with the demands of England's top division. Going to the UK, and eventually _returning_ will limit the man's true ability.

If **Thiago Alcantara** knows what is best for his footballing career, then he will stay with Barcelona and learn from the living legends around him. England and the Premier League can be an option for him in the future, but a move to Old Trafford in 2013 would see him lose his true potential of becoming a leading Spanish centre midfielder.

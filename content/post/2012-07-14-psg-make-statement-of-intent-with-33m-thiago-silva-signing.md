Manchester City, lookout.  
There's a new big spending kid on the block and he happens to be ready to break transfer records. Today, after prolonged discussions, PSG announced the official signing of Thiago Silva for €42m. Yes, forty-two millions euros. The signing marks the intentions of the Parisian side's owners as they gear up to challenge for the Champions League and every trophy domestically. Silva, 27 is expected to the first of a double swoop from the Italian giants with the infamous and widely idolised Zlatan Ibrahimovic likely to sign the <!--more--> dotted line for the French side in the coming days, marking a staggering and indeed historic spending spree from Paris Saint Germain.

Silva, is to pick up €7.5m a year with a further €1m in bonuses should the side improve on last seasons endeavours - not too shabby at all. Clearly, however, Silva hasn't been signed for fun. PSG feel their time has come to challenge the biggest clubs in Europe for coveted silverware, and want to reestablish the Parc des Princes side as one of the biggest clubs in the world.

As with Manchester City, in only a couple of years, they managed to go from midtable to Premier League champions - purely from financial investment and quite frankly: dishing out millions to the best players they could get their hands on.  
As filthy and unsporting as that sounds, unfortunately, it does work as we saw with Roberto Mancini's side this season. 

In the next 48 hours - PSG are widely expected to announce the capture of Ibrahimovic from Milan for a fee considerable less than Silva's. This double signing would mark a huge boost to AC Milan's bank account, and indeed make the 2012/13 Champions League campaign the most anticipated in years.

Your thoughts are indeed welcome.

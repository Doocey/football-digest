There's something nostalgic about Southampton's timely return to the Premier League. I remember the days Anders Svensson, James Beattie, Brett Ormerod to name a few. Who could ever forget James Beattie's penalty taking technique? And those 23 goals his scored in the league?  
A decade or so on and Southampton have built themselves up from the lowest of the low and have reached the adored Premier League again. This time, the likes of Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana will hope to fire Southampton to safety, despite a rather frustrating start. Last weekends <!--more--> defeat at home to Wigan Athletic, had papers claiming that the Saints would find it hard to keep themselves in the top division this season, however from their first performances away to champions Manchester City: Nigel Adkins side have plenty in their locker to stay afloat.

The likely arrival of the much sought GastÃ³n RamÃ­rez signals a very impressive piece of business by the club. The fee is in and around Â£11m, but according to many reports - this guy has the potential to double that value at the very least.  
Liverpool tried to sign him, but he liked the ambition Southampton were showing, and in the next few days it's expected he'll be an official Saint. (Not in the religious terms of course!)

While the home affair with Wigan was a game that Southampton really should have been winning, there are plenty of points yet to play for and fans need to relax quite a bit.  
I watched their encounter with City in Manchester; the passing, movement, and understanding between the majority of the Southampton players was very impressive for a newly promoted side.

Their two goals were excellent finishes; clinical and accurate.  
The build-up to those goals was very positive and if they can play that type of football against the best team in the league away from home - who knows what they can do against slightly easier opposition from now until the end of the season.

Home form will be absolutely crucial to them, but that goes for every other team in the league looking to make progress. You have to try make your backyard a fortress. Stoke City in their first season back in the PL are a perfect example of exactly that.

I like to think I'm a pretty good judge of teams and their ability, and even from that single game against City I saw more than enough to indicate Nigel Adkins side will survive - quite comfortably.

The signing of RamÃ­rez will only improve their chances, and add an exciting threat going forward. Besides the 6 points my beloved Newcastle United are going to take from them, I think they'll fare out reasonably well! ðŸ˜€

In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if all three newly promoted sides stayed up, but we are a long, long way from picking sides to face the drop just yet! Only time will tell.

![Robin van Persie celebrates after scoring for Arsenal](/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Robin-van-Persie-Arsenal.jpg)

It is news that Arsenal fans have dreaded, but expected for some time. Robin van Persie has let the Arsenal board know that he isn't willing to sign a new deal, and will seek a move away from the Emirates before the start of the new season. van Persie ended up top of the scoring charts in the Premier League, yet despite this, his side still only managed a third place and failed to secure any silverware.

Arsenal's dependency on the Dutchman up front was evident all season and the fact he isn't willing to pen a new contract causes more concern for Arsenal fans than ever before.

The question must be asked why van Persie wants a move away? Does he feel - despite the impressive signings of Lukas Podolski and Olivier Giroud - that Arsenal are not moving forward as a club? Or, at the age of 28, does he want to depart for financial reasons?

First off, Robin has been a brilliant servant to the club and has scored bucket loads of goals for the London side every season he has been fit. Many people ask the question whether Arsenal would have won more titles and silverware if van Persie hadn't suffered so many niggling injuries. It's six of one, and half a dozen of the other though.

Secondly, Manchester City seem his most likely suitors when he leaves, and as we all know; they will offer the best financial package in the Premier League. If I was to hazard a guess of his potential wages at City, I'd say they would be hitting the Â£200,000 mark at the very least.

Of course his departure doesn't mean Arsenal will be left stranded. They have prepared themselves well, with the signings of Giroud and Podolski: two natural goalscorers. There's definitely 30 goals between them in a season, if not more. We'll just have to see how they gel together.

When it comes to van Persie, I just hope he makes a career benefiting decision. Whether Manchester City offer both that and financial incentive it'll remain to be seen but what we do know is that - unless he has a change of heart - he won't be pulling on a Gunners jersey in August.

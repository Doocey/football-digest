![David Villa celebrates after scoring for Barcelona](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/David-Villa-FC-Barcelona.jpg)

Sunday night must have been well worth the wait for newly bearded David Villa.  

Not only did he finally make his long-awaited return to football; he also got on the score sheet, in front of a rapturous reception at Camp Nou. As soon as his feet hit the manicured blades of grass that populate the Camp Nou, he knew the response would be, as is the mantra of How I Met Your Mother's Barney Stinson, legendary. Spectators leapt up from their seats in perfect sync, making a mockery of the attempts from Tom Daley and Peter Waterfield, the diving duo who graced our TV screens at this summer’s Olympics but ultimately came home empty-handed, and welcomed their hero, and star talisman, back to where he belonged.

This return was a long, arduous journey back that's been the 30-year-old's worst injury to date. Many assumed that Villa would heal by the time of Spain's quest to consolidate their position as Europe's number one powerhouse. But, as it was revealed that he'd be unable to come back in time, he instead focused his sights on 19th August for Real Sociedad. He was forced to wait 74 minutes until Vilanova reckoned it was safe enough to release him back into the wild. Cue the heart-warming response from Camp Nou and what followed was what made the return all the more sweeter as _El Guaje_ swept the ball into the back of the net, courtesy of a mazy Iniesta dribble. Villa himself was overjoyed with the response, claiming: 'It is a very happy day, this is a very important step for me. I appreciate all the support I have received during these eight months. The reception from the crowd gave me goosebumps. I am in a good moment now, with five weeks training at full pace. It is best to be patient and keep improving so I can play a full game as soon as possible.'

While the goal had no real impact on the result, fans still rejoiced in unison, to celebrate the barrier Villa had finally managed to clear, having fallen at several earlier on his way back.

The question now is, though, whether Villa can reclaim his place on the podium as Spain's most prolific striker.   
Having missed out on a year where the Catalans failed to capture the league title in Pep's everlasting list of accolades, Villa's return will take some of the much-needed pressure of little Leo Messi's shoulders. Although _La Pulga_ enjoyed his finest season to date, grabbing a mind-blowing 73 goals across all competitions, and a handful more of assists, he can’t be the only one scoring or else Barcelona’s overeliance on the 25-year-old may come back to haunt them. Xavi was one player to step up last season while Villa was out, having been pushed “10-15 metres further” up the pitch with Guardiola at the helm and it showed as he finished the season with his best ever goal-scoring campaign, entering double figures.

Last season, although the diminutive Argentine rewrote the record books in exhilarating fashion, Barça looked jaded when the responsibility relied elsewhere. Last season Messi was directly responsible for 57.8% of Barçelona's goals in the league, compared to just 51.5% a season prior, as well as Messi improving his shot per game by one from 2010/11. This represents the increased workload Messi's been forced to take on because of the Spaniard's long-term absence. (Barça may have achieved a significantly higher amount of goals scored last season but that is down to the one-man mission that Messi undertook.)

Spain too fared considerably well without Villa, almost like he hadn’t even been missing with Fernando Torres ending the tournament with the Golden Boot, with yet another goal in the final. The question about Spain that intrigued many throughout the EURO’s was their false nine tactic, where they effectively played a strikerless formation. They employed Cesc Fabregas as their ‘false nine’ striker, and though he did “very well” in that position according to Del Bosque, it perhaps highlighted Del Bosque’s lack of confidence in Spain’s actual strikers in Poland sad of Villa.

This year though, with a new manager comes fresh ideas and Villa will more than likely feature heavily in Vilanova's plans, as he competes for his position with the likes of Pedro and Alexis Sanchez. Villa recently conveyed his optimism in an interview to Mundo Deportivo, saying that: _“my goal is not to be the player I was before the injury, but an even better player.”_

If he precedes to keeps that promise, La Liga defences will want to watch their back.

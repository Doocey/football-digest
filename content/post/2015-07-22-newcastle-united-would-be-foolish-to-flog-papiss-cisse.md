I'll admit - I've always been a fan of **Papiss Demba Cissé**. When he arrived from Freiburg in January 2012 it didn't take us long to see what a goalscorer he really is. His debut was one to remember as he [fired in an absolute beauty][1] to secure all three points against Aston Villa. However, that was only the start as the Senegalese forward went on to score 13 goals in 14 games in his first season in the Premier League - an incredible feat. The decision to hand him the famous #9 jersey looked like a masterstroke from all involved at Newcastle United as the club steamrolled their way to a remarkable 5th place finish thanks to a big goal haul from both Papiss and Demba Ba throughout the season. The following campaign saw European football return to St. James' Park and as per usual, domestic form suffered, almost ending in another relegation. Although Papiss hit another 13 goals that term, it marked a disappointing return for both the forward and supporters as a whole.

The 2013/14 season saw the arrival of **Loic Rémy** from QPR on a season-long loan and the Frenchman enjoyed a fine spell on Tyneside firing in 14 goals in 26 appearances, helping Newcastle United finish in the all-glorious 10th position in the Premier League. Papiss, however, through injury and a lack of playing time managed just four goals in Black and White. His time in the North East looked to be coming to an end.

Fastforward to **September 2014** and Cissé is about to make his first appearance since April. Trailing 0-2 at home to Hull City Cissé arrived off the bench and quickly found his goalscoring form by scoring twice in 15 minutes to salvage a point for a struggling Newcastle United. He then carried on with another brace away at Swansea City, a crucial effort at Burnley, another two goals at home to Chelsea, one against Everton, another at Crystal Palace, and yet another pivotal goal against Aston Villa.

Those **11 goals** kept **Newcastle United in the Premier League last season** - make no mistake about that.

With that said and done - there has been an increasing number of supporters that are eager to get rid of Papiss Cissé and it looks like the club will let him go if they receive a half decent offer for his services. His disciplinary record is poor for a striker, and the spitting incident with Manchester United's Johnny Evans last season was despicable behaviour to say the very least. Papiss' hasn't had a great run with injuries either and is yet to put a full season together at St. James' Park.

He has also just turned 30 years of age and some might argue that is his best days are behind him. As well as that, **Aleksandar Mitrovic** has arrived from Anderlecht to head our attack for the coming season.

I disagree though - I think Papiss has as a future at Newcastle United. He is one of the most potent finishers on Tyneside that I've seen in quite a few years. Demba Ba was a natural goalscorer but he eyes are only ever on dollar signs. I'm not sure the same can be said for Papiss - money isn't everything to him. According to **Alan Pardew**, John Carver, and most recently Steve McClaren, Papiss is a very popular figure with the squad behind the scenes and losing those personalities before the season can have damaging effects whether anyone likes to admit it or not.

Papiss is one of the best finishers the club has had on its ranks since Alan Shearer hung up his boots. Cissé is a natural goalscorer - the sheer quality of his goals for Newcastle United over the past few years have been ridiculously good.

Considering there was a serious lack of proper service from midfield last season, Cissé did brilliantly to score 11 goals in 22 games. Now with **[Georginio Wijnaldum][2]** and Siem de Jong ready to provide ammunition I think we'd be very foolish to flog the Senegalese striker.

He's a goalscorer - simple as that, and we likes those on Tyneside.

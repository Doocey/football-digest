![Keith Andrews runs off to celebrate after scoring Ireland's opening goal in Tallinn](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Keith_Andrews_Ireland.jpg)

**THIS** time two years ago Ireland were gearing up for France, and their arrival to Croke Park for the first leg of a World Cup 2012 play-off.

As we all know; what happened in the following leg was possibly one of footballs biggest scandals with Thierry Henry hand-balling not once, but twice and assisting William Gallas to score the all-important decisive goal in ET.

However, in 2011, Ireland are all but guaranteed their place in Poland and Ukraine following a very comprehensive four nil thrashing of Tarmo Rüütli's Estonia, in Tallinn.

Keith Andrews nodded the first, whilst Robbie Keane grabbed a brace; one a real poachers effort and the second from the penalty spot after Stephen Hunt was taken down.

The impressive victory marked another clean sheet for Trappatoni's men - and the Boys In Green have only conceded one goal in nearly 1000 minutes of football.

A very impressive feat considering the vulnerability of our back line.

Although we're not technically guaranteed a spot in Poland-Ukraine; it very much looks like Keith Andrews, Glenn Whelan, Stephen Kelly, and even Paul McShane will play in one of Europe's elite competition - despite being very average footballers.

Saying that - it's great to see the likes of Damien Duff, Robbie Keane, Richard Dunne, John O'Shea & Shay Given will get one last crack at a major tournament: their first since South Korea & Japan, back in 2002.

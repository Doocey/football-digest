Newcastle United fans witnessed the first official match under the Steve McClaren regime. It was a pleasure to watch organized football, with strategy and a plan to build up from the back. A **2-2 draw** at home versus a tough Southampton opponent, with 2 new faces in the starting lineup, one of which barely had any time with the team (Mbemba). Southampton went up 1-0 on a header from Pelle. Papiss Cissé later equalized when a Haidara cross was deflected on the goal line and Cissé chested it in. NUFC would later go ahead minutes after halftime, when a beautiful cross from Obertan met Wijnaldum’s head and into the back of the net. In the 79<sup>th</sup> minute, Shane Long equalized for Southampton, with a header over Janmaat.

Below I’ve listed my 20 thoughts and tidbits on the match:

  * Newcastle’s play was refreshing to watch, have not said that under Pardew in years. With some strategy, purpose and build up, Newcastle looked like a real team today.
  * Southampton is a great team, this was not an easy opponent by any means (lost 2-1 and 4-0 to them last season). Newcastle was dominating for the most part of the match. There was a quality opportunity from **Wijnaldum** in the box when it was still 0-0 and two plays that should’ve been whistled for a PK in NUFC’s favor.
  * What a coup NUFC have in **Chancel Mbemba**, though. My word. This guy has all the traits to be a monster in this league. He’s already played a better match than any Yanga-Mbiwa has played in black & white. The mobility, pace, anticipation and tackling is on point. Refreshing to watch after years of Steven Taylor & Mike Williamson. He’s the real deal.
  * Coloccini wasn’t up to par. He also didn’t play a single pre-season game, you can’t blame him. Hopefully that’ll be cleaned up.
  * **Haidara** had a shocking first half. Not enough has been made on the transfer front for Newcastle in terms of LB interest. Need someone else there. Him and Obertan looked vulnerable all match on the left side.

  * Speaking of **Obertan**; 90 mins? I’ve spoken before about how imperative it will be to give Mitrovic good service. I’d like to see Aarons get some playing time, very unfortunate he did not play today. Thought he would’ve been subbed on for Obertan, without a doubt.
  * Wijnaldum looks like the real deal, too. Tip of the hat to Graham Carr, Lee Charnley and the director’s board. What a player. Saw some strong runs, Moussa Sissoko-type. Those two in the midfield will be a nightmare for oppositions. Beautiful goal too, seems to have a knack for putting the ball in the net.
  * Newcastle looked distorted after **Vurnon Anita** went down. No more creativity or calmness in the midfield. Tioté is not the player he used to be. A liability on the pitch. Would have rather saw De Jong come on for Anita, push Wijnaldum to the #6 role and Colback take Anita’s position, with De Jong playing the 10. Especially considering Tioté hadn’t played a game all pre-season.
  * **Moussa Sissoko**, amongst many others, looked absolutely gassed as the game went on. Some of these guys are lacking fitness and durability, but it is also the first game of the season.
  * You know who isn’t lacking fitness? **Jack Colback**. Absolutely saved Newcastle in the end with a blocked shot that would’ve put Southampton ahead. Does this man ever get tired? Seriously. Geordie hero.
  * **Alexsandar Mitrovic** looked a little bit lost out there. Also don’t blame him, first PL match and big expectations. Now that he’s got that under his belt, hopefully he’ll start focusing on the game of football. Had a yellow less than 30 seconds into his debut. Extremely talented player but he also needs good service. Obertan is not the answer.
  * **Daryl Janmaat** has struggled for quite some time now in defending headers. Newcastle have a short back four, per se. Would like to see something done about that. Whether it’s bringing in a taller CB (Matip, for example). Janmaat doesn’t have many deficiencies but aerial ability is one of them.
  * Seems like **Tim Krul** could’ve had a better jump on both goals. He did make one big save on a set piece where somehow there were 5 Southampton players absolutely free.
  * Speaking of _set pieces_. When is this team going to figure out how to defend them? My goodness. Coloccini needs to be more vocal on who’s defending who, and handing out assignments. Too many players with their hands up, flagging the linesman for offside instead of picking up their assignment. Pathetic.
  * After today’s match, you can easily see the glaring needs for Newcastle. A LB, without a doubt. Would like to also see another winger come in and a CB.
  * This was also one of the _strongest benches_ we’ve seen from Newcastle in quite some time. Aarons, Mitrovic, Ayoze, De Jong, Tiote, Taylor.
  * Thought **Papiss Cissé** was not a threat, either. Scored a goal because of his unbelievable instinct for the net, but other than that, wasn’t good. Need a player who can hold up the ball. De Jong did not do much when he was subbed on, either.
  * Biggest accomplishment of all: Mike Williamson was not involved whatsoever. That in itself is an accomplishment. Well done Steve, you’ve got some brownie points for that! (Must’ve read my [#1 key for a successful NUFC season][1])
  * Noticed Mitrovic’s pace, once again. Still don’t see how Newcastle would ever be able to play him and Austin on the pitch together. Mitrovic was having trouble running down defenders. For those who say he’s got pace, I did not see it today. Doubt we’ll ever see Austin and him on the pitch together, it would make Newcastle very vulnerable defensively.
  * Newcastle should’ve been up early but couldn’t finish. At the end, they were lucky to come out with a draw. Fitness seemed to be an issue, but then again, two players (Coloccini & Tioté) did not play a single pre-season match. Hopefully with this match behind them, the fitness level will not be a concern in the next game. Now NUFC can look onto their next opponent, at Swansea next weekend. Talk to you then.

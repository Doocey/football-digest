![Ji Sung Park celebrates scoring for Manchester United against Chelsea](http://www.footballdigest.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Ji-Sung-Park-Manchester-United.jpg)

Manchester United reign supreme once again. Instead of Rooney or Giggs nabbing the all important goals, there is a new man continuing to bore his way into Manchester United's famous history. Chicharito Hernandez. The Mexican - who impressed me for one at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa was on the end of a brilliant low Ryan Giggs cross-shot, which he drove into the root of the net. Despite Chelsea's first half dominance which saw United chase shadows for prolonged period;, neither Frank Lampard nor Anelka had their shooting boots on, and wasted some excellent opportunities to send Chelsea into a comfortable HT lead.

Anelka drove inches wide of the post from a scramble inside the box. He then curled a left footed attempt just millimetres wide of the top left hand corner.

Fernando Torres has his chance too, controlling sublimely inside the area before trying the acrobatic attempt which has as much power in it as my index finger.

Then United went forward, on the counter-attack. They looked for openings and found one - Rooney's right footed cross met by the head of Hernandez who nodded home brilliantly: only to see the assistant raise his flag whilst on course for his celebration.

United eventually got their breakthrough just before the end of the half.

Giggs pacing inside right and firing a left-footed cross-shot into the path of the Mexican who really couldn't miss; although his attempt signaled he tried as hard as he could!

Drogba came on and was magnificent. His physical presence could not be dealt with and we saw this especially when he fired home the goal of the game. Powering by Vidic, and then slotting it home with his right. A goal that deserved to win any game.

30 seconds later - Park had United 3-1 up and the game was inevitably over.

Chelsea were caught on the counter again.

In a very impressive performance from Ancelotti's men - they yet again crashed out of the UEFA Champions League at the crucial stage. Perhaps they didn't deserve to based on the 2nd leg but their 1st affair was their let down. The better side overall went through to face Schalke (unless Inter mount an unbelievable comeback).

Another year down - another United team on course for silverware.

What's new?

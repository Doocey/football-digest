Glad this one is over. A sluggish start for Newcastle, who found themselves down a goal after 9 minutes. Shelvey slipped a pass through Newcastle’s back four and found Gomis all by himself with Krul, made a move and put it past the keeper. Janmaat kept Gomis onside, it was Mbemba’s man but he held the line properly. Coloccini needs to take control and leadership of his back line, absolutely poor on his part. After the goal, Newcastle seemed to turn the tide a bit and settle down, until the 41<sup>st</sup> minute, where Janmaat was handed his 2<sup>nd</sup> yellow and sent off. It was all Swansea from there. In the 52<sup>nd</sup> minute, Andre Ayew scored on a header (of course), with a beautiful cross from Montero. A very poor display, with some injury concern to Sissoko and a red to Janmaat, Newcastle United are in trouble next weekend at Old Trafford.

Here are my 20 thoughts and tidbits:

  * This was the complete opposite of the **Southampton** match. Very sloppy defending, no control, a sluggish start and some disciplinary problems.
  * Speaking of disciplinary issues: we got a little glimpse of the deep-rooted issues that has surrounded this club under Pardew and Carver today. With Janmaat’s red, that is now 5 red cards in 12 matches for Newcastle United. Absolutely inexcusable, we all thought McClaren would clean up the identity and discipline of this club. Haven’t seen it yet, but it’s very, very early in the process.
  * **Haidara** was once again shocking today. Not the answer at LB. Perhaps Dummett is the answer; I don’t know but would love to see another LB brought in. I’ve been yearning for Ghoulam at LB, would fit McClaren’s philosophy and back four perfectly.
  * **Chancel Mbemba** looked good, I don’t fault him for the goal, it was on Janmaat, who kept Gomis onside. When Janmaat received the red card, Mbemba was slotted in at RB and held his own but you can tell he did not look comfortable. Montero got the best of him only once but Mbemba won a few tackles.
  * With **Janmaat’s** red, he will miss the next match vs Manchester United. There aren’t any other RB options on the roster; this was one of the issues in the transfer window. I’m dreading having Mbemba play there with Steven Taylor in the middle. Chancel’s preferred and best position is CB; please do not turn him into another Yanga-Mbiwa! He does not have the creativity or passing touch to be a RB, he’s a rugged player with great pace, and unbelievable tackling skills but does not bring much going forward.
  * Daryl Janmaat was not good today, at all. The same player, who was without a doubt the most consistent for Newcastle last season, has started this one off on the wrong foot. Perhaps the one man we cannot afford to lose. He had a dreadful match, we understand the gameplan was to shut down Montero, but Janmaat is much better than that. Should’ve been a lot more cautious with an early yellow and the referee did let him get away with a few bad tackles but enough was enough. Even the match commentators kept mentioning how Janmaat needs to be more careful.
  * Was also quite disappointed in **Georginio Wijnaldum**. I do not think his best position is the #10. He should be playing next to Colback in the middle, as a #6, have Colback play Anita’s position and De Jong at the #10, but of course that was not possible today with Siem’s injury. Gini played well vs Southampton, but did not notice him much today. To be fair, no one played well.
  * Hopefully this puts an end to the _Obertan vs Aarons_ debate. Rolando needs to start, he’s not the type of player that gets put on the pitch as a sub and thrives. He’s the type that gets better as the match goes on, needs to get his feet settled. I would like to see him start next match.
  * Did **Papiss Cissé** play today? He had 26 touches today in 54 minutes. Mitrovic had 32 touches in 13 minutes. Outrageous that McClaren keeps going back to Papiss.
  * On that note, why did the board pay £13M to have Mitrovic ride the bench? Him, along with Aarons, need to start vs Man U next weekend. They are the types of players that get better as the match goes on. Both need to start to have an impact on the match.
  * What’s happened to **Tim Krul**, by the way? Has been in shocking form since the World Cup heroics. I love this article by Malcolm MacDonald, an inside [look at Krul’s recent struggles][1].
  * The back four gave up another headed goal today. Look at [how poorly Coloccini defended Ayew’s goal][2]. This is our captain, people. Embarrassing.
  * You could blame Coloccini’s fitness for his poor form last weekend, but enough is enough, he is not the same player he used to be. It is time to move on.
  * If there are any positives from this match, it’s that the board and Steve McClaren will realize that 3 players in are not sufficient. **McClaren** has recently stated that he is happy with the transfers and the way the team looks. Today’s result questions McClaren’s statements. The club needs more than 3. There are some glaring holes, a LB (Haidara?), CB (Coloccini?), winger (Obertan?). And now add to the fact that there are injury concerns to De Jong and Sissoko, it may hopefully fasten the process to bring some players in.
  * For the record, I’ve been supporting McClaren’s tactics and philosophy since his appointment, but playing 4-5-0 today was mind-boggling. This is not the club I chose to support. McClaren took Cissé off and put Aarons on but kept Mitrovic on the bench until the 82<sup>nd</sup> minute and replaced Obertan for him. You’d rather be happy with a 2-0 loss while parking the bus, than trying to get some goals while being vulnerable defensively and perhaps losing 4-0? I’d rather a team that tries!
  * If you think Mitrovic isn’t fit enough to play, do you think throwing him on the pitch in the 82<sup>nd</sup> minute will change that? He’s too good of a player to not be starting. (Ps, I’m still trying to figure out why this was deemed a yellow card. [Mitrovic is growing a bad reputation][3], Tioté-esque. Not good.
  * Gomis and Ayew scored for Swansea. How ironic; two players that have been linked to Newcastle for a few years now.
  * Anita took a step back for me today. Was quiet. Thought he was very instrumental in the last match but was invisible today. Steven Taylor was surprisingly good.
  * These road matches are becoming an issue. Newcastle have won 1 game on the road in the last 14 and have had 1 clean sheet in the last 13. Problematic.
  * Is it time to panic? I don’t think so. It’s still very early in the season but NUFC have one of the toughest start of the season schedule in the whole PL. These are the types of matches they need to get a point out of, especially with the likes of Man U, West Ham, Arsenal, Chelsea and Man City coming up. For now, it’s one match at a time. It’ll be a great match next weekend at Old Trafford, talk to you then!

The 2014 World Cup marked a too familiar story for England and their fans. An opening loss to Italy dealt the nation with an irreparable blow that ultimately saw their exit from the worlds biggest sporting tournament.

Although remnants of hope remained as Roy Hodgson's men prepared to face a poorly Uruguay outfit, the South Americans - aided by the return of a potent Luis Suarez - showed a desire to win that their opponents, England, have not mustered up for quite a few decades. Condemned to two losses and an early exit from the group stage, the English media geared up their weapons, ready to fire ammunition at particular squad members, and of course, their head-coach. The same old story for England.

One of the issues discussed after the defeat to Uruguay was the central defensive pairing of Everton's Phil Jagielka and Blues' stopper, Gary Cahill. The pairing came in for major criticism in the wake of Suarez's opener, as the Liverpool forward ghosted in behind Jagielka to exquisitely nod his nation in front. The marking might not have been world-class, but the reaction surrounding it was a tad over the top. One has to applaud both the movement and indeed the pin-point cross from the provider, Edinson Cavani.

As an Irishman myself, I watched the game on national television, and was forced to listen to some very questionable and quite frankly, incorrect post-match analysis. Resident pundit, Eamon Dunphy (who is very much worth searching for on YouTube if you aren't familiar with him) found himself entangled in a heated argument with ex-Birmingham City defender Kenny Cunningham regards the omission of John Terry from the England squad.

Dunphy claimed that the Blues' defender should have been at the heart of the defence alongside Cahill, in place of Jagielka who he deemed insufficient at World Cup level. Cunningham disagreed, and believed that the right squad had travelled to Brazil to contest.

However, such exchanges weren't just native to RTE2 and Dunphy, but across the board, including the _BBC_, _ITV_, and indeed the _Telegraph_. Former Arsenal defender Tony Adams investigated the crucial mistakes made by Hodgson in his defensive setup - a pretty irrelevant article to publish **after** England's exit.

Personally, there should be no debate. Roy Hodgson's decision to bring the squad he did, was completely justified. John Terry - who had no part to play in the side's qualification for Brazil - had absolutely no right to be on the plane to Brazil. Why would he?

This is a guy who had been punished by the FA for his conduct in a Premier League match with Queens Park Rangers which involved undoubted derogatory language spouted in the direction of opponent Anton Ferdinand.

On the pitch, he has proven himself to be diminishing defender of late, and if one really believes that a 33 year-old Terry would have been a superior replacement for Jagielka, then I can only question that judgement.

John Terry **did not deserve** to be anywhere _near_ the England setup in Brazil, and I am glad that Hodgson did the right thing in picking an in-form squad. The countless articles written analyzing where England went wrong and how they would have been better off with Terry are beginning to bore.

At the end of the day, England exited the World Cup in the group stages because they did not have a _winning mentality_. The humidity and heat obviously hindered the Three Lions even further, but their elimination was most certainly not due to the fact they did not bring Terry, or indeed Ashley Cole.

Terry's England career should be finished, especially considered he opted to retire from the scene not too long ago.

In the nation wants to succeed, they need to cut all ties Terry and Cole. Gerrard's future in the side is also questionable, but only with the right mentality, correct coaching, and a strong, united relationship within the squad will England ever seriously contest a major tournament in the future.

Sacking Hodgson won't solve it either.

The hard work starts now.

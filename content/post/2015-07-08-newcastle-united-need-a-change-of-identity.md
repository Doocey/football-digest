Long gone are the days of **Sir Bobby Robson** and Alan Shearer. The days where Newcastle United was a feared group of players, a team that the opposition would circle on their calendars months in advance. With one of the best stadiums, a loyal and passionate fan base and an elite scouting network, it simply does not make sense that NUFC keeps struggling year after year. I was never in the “Pardew Out” brigade, but having a switch in the managerial position could have been a blessing in disguise. Yes, just merely avoiding relegation could have also been a blessing disguise. Why? Because it meant a major change was in order. Hopefully that dire shift will bring back the Geordie identity that Sir Bobby once brought to St. James on a weekly basis.

Newcastle United have not finished higher in the English Premier League table than 3<sup>rd</sup> place since the 2002-2003 campaign; the middle of a stretch of 3 consecutive seasons with top 5 finishes (2001-2002: 4<sup>th</sup>; 2002-2003: 3<sup>rd</sup> & 2003-2004: 5<sup>th</sup>). Since then, NUFC finished 5<sup>th</sup> only once again (2011-2012) and were also relegated in 2009. Under Alan Pardew, Newcastle United finished 12<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> (although he left midway through the season).

How does the shift in identity happen? Well, you start by appointing a brand new manager and clearing the previous manager’s backroom staff. NUFC left go of Steve Stone and John Carver shortly after the season ended and have completely flipped the whole coaching staff since the arrival of Steve McClaren.

**[Ian Cathro][1]**, Paul Simpson, Steve Black and Alessandro Schoenmaker have formed to make the new backroom team. Goalkeeping coach Andy Woodman has been rumoured to join Alan Pardew at Crystal Palace, which means Eric Steele would come to NUFC from Derby as a replacement. Furthermore, On June 10<sup>th</sup>, owner Mike Ashley stepped down from the Newcastle board and placed Steve McClaren there; the only head coach in the EPL to be named to the director’s board. All of these moves are a massive step forward in an attempt to change the identity of __Newcastle United__.

Steve McClaren sent an e-mail to fans last week that mentioned: “It is so important that the right players come through the door. However long that takes, I want to make sure that we have just the type of people who can come in and force us forward. The plan we have as a club excites me. It isn't a quick fix, it’s not going to happen overnight. It’s going to take patience and ups and downs, knocks, highs and lows, but we have an opportunity over time to really make a statement”. Would you rather bring players in just for the sake of bringing them in? Sign players who see Newcastle as nothing but a stepping-stone to bigger things, like **Yohan Cabaye**, Loïc Rémy and Mathieu Débuchy? Or someone like Jack Colback, who pours his heart out on the pitch every time he steps on it. I vote the latter and those are the type of players NUFC need to bring over the line. This is why I have no problem with McClaren taking his time and making sure to bring in the right character of players.

The identity of the Magpies is definitely attached to the system created by Mike Ashley but also through several players. Take **Mike Williamson**, for example, who has been nothing but a burden on the pitch every single game, he does not bring any positive to the team and 92% of fans would agree with me ([according to here][2]), yet he started most of the games last season. **John Carver** claimed that Williamson deliberately got himself a red card to get off the pitch one game last season; pathetic. Next is Cheick Tioté. A rugged center midfielder, with zero awareness, creativity or skills but plays very aggressive. Playing alongside Cabaye for a few years was fine because of Yohan’s high level of skill, but with someone like Colback, it simply won’t work. Tioté’s reputation tends to get the best of him, and even when he wins a clean tackle, the referee will call it a foul simply due to his appellation. There was a video that surfaced this year where Tioté was caught telling someone that [Newcastle is a “sh*t team][3]”. How would the teammates react to this? NUFC need to be bringing players over the line that are PROUD to wear the black and white, not ashamed. Men who will put their teammates ahead of themselves and play for the crest on the front of their kit, not for the name on the back. This is why I’m ok with McClaren taking his time, and this is how the identity of the organization will change.

On Monday July 6<sup>th</sup>, NUFC held a fan forum and Steve McClaren attended, where he occasionally brought up the words “culture, respect and discipline”. The manager mentioned several times that he intends on instilling a [new culture and a new philosophy][4]. It is also clear that McClaren is aiming to address the team’s discipline and focus. For example, there are signs all over the training grounds now that no longer permit the use of mobile phones. These are the small things that hopefully can instill strictness in a club that utterly lacked it last season. On the contrary, Alan Pardew had the team install individual lockers where they can keep their [phones charged at all times last season][5]; a complete 180 in rational and system.

Some of you may say that the culture, identity and character will never change as long as Mike Ashley is owner of the club. Whilst I tend to agree, only time will really tell if **Steve McClaren** is a “yes man” or if he will be the man to change the identity of one of the biggest clubs in the UK. As he mentioned in the e-mail, no one said this would be a quick fix. The transfers will (hopefully) eventually come, the identity of the club will (hopefully) eventually change and the days of Sir Bobby will (hopefully) return to the North-East.

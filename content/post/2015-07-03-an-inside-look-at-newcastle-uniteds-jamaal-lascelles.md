Barring any new signings or transfers at center back, Fabricio Coloccini, Steve Taylor, Mike Williamson and **Jamaal Lascelles** will be battling for first team spots on the pitch this upcoming season. The first 3 names are quite familiar, as a matter of fact, they are the same center backs that Newcastle United has had since their Championship season in 2009-2010. However, the last name is a little bit of an unknown. Jamaal Lascelles is a 21-year-old center back that Newcastle signed in August of 2014 from Nottingham Forest on a 4-year transfer. He was then loaned back to Nottingham Forest for the 2014-2015 campaign, playing a total of 24 matches and had 1 goal. Most **Nottingham Forest** fans will claim that Lascelles started the season slow and did not get first team starts, but the second half was a completely different player. His slow start could have been due to the extra curricular activities that were surrounding Jamaal. In December, he appeared in court over an alleged bar assault in Derby. The charges were dropped but you can sense that it impacted his on field performance. However, as the season went on, his play got stronger and stronger. Forest fans will tell you that you were finally able to start seeing his potential and prospective. The England U-21 international still has a bright future and raw ability with time to round out his game. He also has experience with **Steve McClaren** while at Nottingham Forest but it was very brief since Lascelles was on the youth team while McClaren was the first team manager at the time. Nevertheless, Lascelles told 

_nufc.co.uk_ that he was fascinated by the short conversations they had and his football tactics and philosophy. “When the head coach was at Forest I was 16 and still with the youth team, so didn't have too much to do with him. But from what I know of him, he's great at what he does. He got Derby playing some great football in the Championship, so just imagine what he can do with these boys here. He wants us to be professional, show the right attitude and play in a certain way. That's worked for him over the years and, with the talent in the squad here, there's no reason [why we can't do really well][1]”. It is fresh to hear positive reviews on McClaren, surely Steve will embrace the comments from Lascelles. The 21 year-old center back was also linked to Arsenal back in 2011 and Nottingham reportedly rejected a £5million bid from the Gunners. I cannot claim to have watched enough Nottingham Forest matches last season to have a concrete opinion; therefore it is quite difficult to interpret first hand the quality of play from Jamaal Lascelles. I reached out to Lee Clarke, a _Nottingham Forest blogger_ and asked what his thoughts were. Lee mentioned that Lascelles struggled earlier on in the season and played a little bit immature:

> “Works hard, very good in the air and challenges hard but he needs first team matches to develop his game. Two seasons ago there was a string of quality matches where you could see the prospective of Jamaal’s talent. However, his game did slightly evolve in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the season”. As most **Newcastle United** fans sit and wait for the first transfer signing, you can almost count Jamaal Lascelles as a new signing. It’s not saying much, but it’s also better than nothing. Steve McClaren sent out an e-mail to fans recently saying “it is so important that the right players come through the door. However long that takes, I want to make sure that we have just the type of people who can come in and force us forward”. Whilst I agree, it is becoming somewhat tiring and exhausting. However, to focus on the positive, if Jamaal Lascelles can put his emotions aside and focus strictly on football, he will be able to develop his game and see first team matches. After all, there isn’t much competition at the centre back position; he only has to beat out Steven Taylor and Mike Williamson. Newcastle fans saw Rolando Aarons’ game develop and take a massive leap throughout last year’s pre-season matches; hopefully this year around it’ll be **Jamaal Lascelles**.

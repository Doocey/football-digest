While Chelsea, Manchester United and even Liverpool strengthen their squad with new faces; Arsenal are facing the likely prospect of losing their key man and their top goalscorer last season. It has become crystal clear to Arsene Wenger, and indeed Arsenal fans that van Persie isn't interested in renewing his contract, and has no desire to play his football at the Emirates this coming season.   
He's looking for a move away, and as soon as possible. Luckily, there's no shortage of suitors for the Dutchman and despite prolonged talks with Manchester City - the Etihad Stadium looks like the 28 year-old's next destination.

As van Persie recovers from a disastrous EURO 2012 campaign with the Netherlands that saw him net only a single goal for the whole competition; he is hoping that his wait for silverware at club level, won't be very long.

The opportunity to move to Manchester City would see him team up with international teammate Nigel de Jong, as well as link up with some of the finest players in the world - the likes of David Silva, Sergio Agüero, and Vincent Kompany to name but a few.  
His wages would be considerably more than what he collects at Arsenal, and in all honesty; he has a real chance of winning not only a Premier League title, but also the much coveted Champions League.

On the other hand, there is the potential to join Manchester United, with Alex Ferguson eager to add another quality forward to the ranks. Having already submitted a £10m bid which was turned downed almost immediately, Ferguson is hoping to lure the Dutchman away from any move to the blue side of Manchester, using his experience and negotiation expertise.

Not only would Manchester United winning the 2012/13 Premier League be something of a feat, if Robin van Persie happened to be part of it, his move to Old Trafford rather than the Etihad would look quite close to a masterstroke. Certainly, money doesn't seem to be an issue with van Persie, he just wants to win trophies before his better days are behind him. Who can blame him?

Juventus are the other team in the race for his signature, and a move to Italy is something that appeals to Robin. However, the Italians are tired of talks, and do not fancy a bidding war, as a result, they have warned Arsenal that they might move away from any potential deal for RVP and instead pursue out of favour Eden Dzeko.

To say the future of Robin van Persie is in a delicate scenario would be putting it lightly.

van Persie is trying to force his way out of Arsenal by refusing to travel with the squad to Asia for their three match tour, just one of many acts he has taken to manoeuver a transfer away from London. He also commented on his official website that he happens to: “disagree on the way Arsenal FC should move forward.”.

While Arsenal maintain that they won't grant him his wish of leaving, it's hard to see what kind benefit retaining him would actually be to the club. His contract is running down all the time, and with that: his value. If they're going to block any move, it's unlikely he'll feature for Arsenal this season at all, and what a waste of wages that would be. It's a brave stance to hold, but how long before they give in, and accept a bid?

The most important aspect of his potential move away from Arsenal to the club at least, is that he doesn't sign for a domestic competitor. Inevitably, they're hoping Juventus will pull out all the stops, meet their valuation of the striker, and jet him off to Italy.

For Arsenal FC, it's not a very nice position to be in, but with Olivier Giroud and Lukas Podolski already in the door at the Emirates; Wenger won't be left in the lurch when/if Robin ends his Gunners career. That however, seems only a matter of time.

![Luka Modric in action for Tottenham Hotspur](/uploads/2012/07/Luka-Modric-Tottenham.jpg)

First it was Redknapp, now it seems their star man is heading towards the door at White Hart Lane. Much alike the van Persie case involving their neighbours; the news has been a long time coming. It seems only a matter of days before Luka Modric completes a move to Spanish champions Real Madrid for a fee in the region of Â£30m.  
Last summer Chelsea offered a fee of Â£40m for the Croatian but somehow, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy managed to block any move, in the hope that the creative midfielder would help Tottenham grab a Champions League spot.

Then he'd let him go, for the right price.Â 

As you all know, Chelsea happened to win the Champions League and since they finished outside the Top 4, they took the CL place of whoever finished fourth. That team was Tottenham and now, in July, they are preparing for the Europa League once again, and likely to lose their best player for Â£10m less than what they could have got for him a year previous.Â 

It all doesn't look very good for Mr Levy.

However, there is hope, as ironic as it can get mind you. Since Harry Redknapp's dismissal, Spurs in the last week appointedÂ **sacked Chelsea manager** AndrÃ© Villas-Boas with the hope of getting the side back into the Champions League for definite this season.

AVB has already completed his first signing and it's a replacement for Modric.Â Gylfi Sigurdsson signed fromÂ Hoffenheim for a fee in the region of Â£8m and being honest, it's a pretty decent replacement, considering he only cost little over a quarter of what Modric is expected to go for in the next few days.

For Real Madrid, I'm not quite sure where Modric will fit in. There will definitely be some tactical changes at the club to involve him, as well as catering for the likes of Alonso, Khedira, Ozil, and others.

However, Jose Mourinho has plans for him and obviously sees him as a very important addition to the side. There's no doubt that after winning the league for the first time in quite while, he will hope to bring the Champions League trophy to Madrid as well. Perhaps Modric is the final piece of the puzzle to securing that coveted trophy.

Only time will tell.

The worst start in 16 years saw Newcastle United drop their 3<sup>rd</sup> game in a row. Six matches into the season and their 0-2-4 start means NUFC are 19<sup>th</sup> in the standings and in relegation battle with fellow North East rivals Sunderland. Playing at home versus a lesser Watford club should’ve been a no-doubt 3 points in the bag. With that being said, no game is played on paper; Watford was the much better team today, plain and simple. Odion Ighalo scored twice for Watford and Daryl Janmaat put away a nice goal for NUFC.

Here are my 20 thoughts and tidbits:

  1. When Steve McClaren was first appointed as manager, there was talk of a new culture, identity, attitude etc. 6 games into the season and other than a draw vs Southampton and draw at Old Trafford, this looks like the exact same team as last season. 50 million spent and it seems like the root of the problem is still prevailing; yet everyone is having a hard time identifying what the exact problem is.
  2. In my opinion, bringing back Fabricio Coloccini is one of those major problems. He is way past his prime and it was time to move on yesterday. Giving him a new contract and handing him the captaincy back after a summer of transfer rumours was a major mistake; he’s been one of the worst, if not the worst, player for NUFC through 6 matches.
  3. The first goal was on Massadio Haidara. He needs to learn to just punt it up the field when no one is available, enough of this fancy stuff and trying to keep possession, or losing the ball in his own end. Mike Williamson can teach him a trick or two.
  4. Today we saw the importance of a full back in McClaren’s tactics through the display and vital role of Janmaat. This is why I am mind boggled that there wasn’t more of a push to upgrade the LB position in the transfer window. Haidara is not good. Names like Faouzi Ghoulam, Jetro Willems and Raphael Guerreiro were the most mentioned. I would not be surprised to see one of those, or any other LB, come to Newcastle in January.
  5. We also saw a very forward formation today. Defensive midfielder Vurnon Anita was on the bench today and Colback was the holding midfielder. Sissoko started the game as the #10. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> half, Siem De Jong was subbed on for Papiss Cissé, LM Ayozé Perez became the lone striker and Sissoko pushed out wide.
  6. Speaking of Cissé, I sincerely hope this is the last we’ve seen of him. Cissé, along with Coloccini, should’ve both been sold this summer. It almost seemed like NUFC played with 10 in the first half because of Cissé’s play.
  7. There was a much better display and push by NUFC in the second half; perhaps this is the formation McClaren will go with from now on. Unfortunately, after Janmaat’s goal, it seemed like it was too little, too late.
  8. Watford is a well coached team, very disciplined and were winning every single 50/50 ball. When that happens, it comes down to which team has the most heart and puts in the most effort, as opposed to being the more skilled club. They were outnumbering every NUFC player 2-1 on every ball, always getting help defensively. Kudos to them. That’s how you win games.
  9. Wijnaldum did not have a good game either. He has been invisible. I’m starting to think McClaren has not found a proper role for him.
 10. I wouldn’t be opposed to seeing Rolando Aarons start at LB. I know it sounds crazy, but I don’t see how it would hurt. He may not have the physical ability or strength to play the position, but how much worse can he be defensively than Haidara? At least he can deliver a proper cross.
 11. Speaking of crosses, or lack thereof, what a poor showing. I can’t count how many times NUFC were delivering crosses, or attempting to, and it was blocked by a Watford player. I thought bringing Thauvin in would change that; apparently not. Strikers are not getting good service from the midfield.
 12. Watching Florian Thauvin today brought back memories of Hatem Ben Arfa and the numerous times he would try to create something when there was nothing happening. Sometimes the simple play is the right play. Get your teammates involved.
 13. Daryl Janmaat was spectacular. He always is. So is Chancel Mbemba. Both players are game in, game out the best players for NUFC on a nightly basis. If only the rest of the team would follow suit.
 14. Sissoko and Janmaat were linking up well in the 2<sup>nd</sup> They have a nice connection.
 15. However, Sissoko did not play well as the #10. He’s much better on the wing. Ayoze was invisible today too.
 16. Back to Coloccini. The second goal was a despicable display of defending by him. There are far too many times where a striker will shield the ball with Coloccini on his back, and Colo will back off, instead of sticking on the striker, which leaves his center back partner vulnerable.
 17. Everyone keeps bringing up Charlie Austin and how £15 million looks like a bargain now. I hate to say it, but bringing Charlie Austin may not change anything if the service is still poor from the midfield. With that being said, anyone is an upgrade over Papiss Cissé nowadays.
 18. With Chelsea and Man City coming up, Newcastle needed to get a minimum of 4 points versus West Ham & Watford, but came out of the two fixtures with 0. Troubling times ahead.
 19. It is far too early in the season to start talking about relegation, but there are some definite reasons to be worried. All the talk by McClaren about changing the identity of the club, yet the same problems are re-surfacing.
 20. Has there ever been a captaincy swap this early into the season? Wouldn’t mind seeing the band going to someone like Janmaat, Colback or even Wijnaldum. I would like to see Lascelles get a shot.

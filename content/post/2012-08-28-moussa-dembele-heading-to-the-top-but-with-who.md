![Moussa Demb√©l√© in action for Fulham"](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Moussa-Demb√©l√©-Fulham.jpg)

I remember watching Moussa Demb√©l√© during his days at AZ Alkmaar and thinking to myself what a fine footballer this fella was going to be.   
Fast-forward¬†five or six years, and Moussa is plying his trade in top league in the world, with Fulham. However, he might not be a Cottager for much longer as the likes of Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and even Real Madrid, have all been linked with a move for the skillful Belgian.  
In other-words, he's a guy in demand, and if you watched him last season, or even the start of this season; you'll see why.

Fulham manager Martin Jol today claimed no club would be able to afford Demb√©l√©, and that the player himself is enjoying his time with Fulham, and indeed the Craven Cottage outfit.

> He plays and he likes the club, so there's no problem. You have to pay a lot of money to get Dembele.  
> There won't be a lot of clubs putting that sort of money on the table, so I think we are fine.

Tottenham, however, are flush with some cash after the sale of Luka Modric, and Demb√©l√© is seen as an ideal acquisition for the style of play AVB is trying to implement at White Hart Lane.

Demb√©l√© is creative, and has the ability to unlock the sternest of defences in the Premier League. He was brilliant against Manchester United just last weekend alongside Bryan Ruiz who pair together quite well. While United have actually been credited with interest in Moussa, it's unlikely that an official approach has been made just yet. Spurs are the most likely of candidates to test the water.

With Jol claiming that no club can match their valuation of the attacking midfielder it begs the question, how much Fulham would actually want before they'd part with him?  
It doesn't take a genius to guess that the figure would certainly be in double figures, but it'd be interesting to see how much the London side actually value Demb√©l√© at.

If there's any Fulham fans out there, what kind of money would you let him go at - if he was to depart the Cottage?

There's little doubt that Demb√©l√© will move on at some stage, and he is heading for the top.   
With such natural ability, it won't be too long before the tall Belgian is playing in the Champions League, but who will that be with?

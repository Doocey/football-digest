While all the focus for Manchester City has been on Robin van Persie and his potential arrival at the Etihad, they've managed to sneak one signing under most of our noses.Â   
Jack Rodwell, Everton's prodigy, will undergo a medical in Manchester later today ahead of aÂ completingÂ a reported Â£15m move.  
Many people will question this move on City's behalf, and will wonder where exactly Rodwell will fit in. However, he is only 21 years old and has his best years ahead of him. A likely replacement for an ageing Gareth Barry <!--more-->, who might well have his finest days behind him in a Citizens shirt.

I'm sure David Moyes sold Rodwell in the best interests of the club, and being fair; Jack's time on Merseyside was counting down for the last two seasons following some very impressive performances.

Rather than questioning Manchester City's motives in the move, it is worth shedding some light on where Everton go from here.  
Who do they replace Rodwell with? Â 

It's been well documented that Everton's finances aren't in the best of shape, and you wouldn't expect them to go out and splash Â£15m on a replacement. My guess, would be that he'll bring someone in for Â£5m or so and once again, they'll have a very positive season.

My own NUFC are trying hard to get Vurnon Anita from Ajax, and it really wouldn't surprise me if Moyes made a cheeky attempt to hijack any move. Anita would fit in very well on Everton if you ask me, but then again, perhaps they already have someone who has slipped my mind, ready to fill the vacant position in midfield.

For any Everton fans out there? Who fills the void left by Rodwell?

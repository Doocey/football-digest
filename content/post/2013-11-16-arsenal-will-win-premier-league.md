Many fans and pundits alike have questioned the Gunners ability to win the Barclays Premier League this season, and perhaps rightly so with Arsenal having not won the league since 2004.   
However, the facts and figures suggest that this season, Wenger will lead his side to a successful league campaign, which should see them become Champions for the first time since the time of the &#8216;Invincibles'.   
As you will all know, Arsenal currently sit atop of the league table with 25 points from their first 11 games with the closest team to them being Liverpool who they dispatched <!--more--> easily with a 2-0 home win at the Emirates.

Most believe this to be down to the fact that Arsene Wenger’s side have had an easy start to the season, but they have played 40% of last season’s top five and the fact is that everybody plays everybody twice. A lot of people are putting the London clubs recent form down to the arrival of Mesut Özil from Real Madrid, but Arsenal have been in title-winning form since January losing only five matches since the turn of the year, the same number that the Champions Manchester United won in last season’s title-winning season.

This makes for good reading if you’re a Gooner, but as critics will point out, four of those five losses came against rivals in the shape of Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and most recently Manchester United. This will lead people to say that Wenger’s team always falters against the top sides but as they showed against Borussia Dortmund just last Wednesday and Bayern Munich in March; they are more than capable of playing and beating Europe’s best.

People then say that these matches are just one-offs and that Arsenal never produce these results over a consistent period of time, but in the last 38 Premier League matches the Gunners have taken 83 points with only Manchester United having more with 85, but the Red Devils have the 27 games from last season to thank for that as opposed to the 11 so far this campaign.

At this point in an argument critics will normally point to Arsenal’s supposedly shaky defence and they get this ‘knowledge’ from watching Match of the Day which often does not show how well a side is organised throughout a game and highlights any major errors made through the 90 minutes.

However, the Gunners had the second meanest defence in the league last season shipping only 37 goals, with runners-up Man City only conceding less with 34. The North London club also has the joint third best back line this campaign with only Spurs and Southampton having conceded less times than the league leaders. Arsenal also kept clean sheets away to Bayern Munich who have scored in 72 of their last 73 games and against Borussia Dortmund who have scored in 62 of their last 63 matches. Weak at the back? Hardly.

In **Per Mertesacker** and Laurent Koscielny, Arsenal have one of the best defensive partnership’s in the league with the pair not having lost a game where they played 90 minutes together since the 22nd January 2012 against Manchester United. People often claim that Mertesacker is too slow to be a world-class centre-half, but 94 caps for Germany would suggest differently.

If anyone still believes that the Gunners don’t have the potential to win this season’s Premier League they need only look to history to contradict them, for in three of the last four Premier League campaigns, the team top of the league after 10 games, which Arsenal were, went onto win the league that year. Aswell as Premier League history Arsenal also have history with **Arsene Wenger** regarding league titles as in Wenger’s three title-winning seasons the Gunners had 24, 19 and 22 points after the first ten games, with this year’s side bettering even the 'Invincibles' after the opening ten fixtures.

Most top pundits also believe that the league title is won on a side’s form away from home and at the minute there is no-one better than the Gunners who currently have the best away record in the league having taken 13 points from their games on the road while rivals Man City have only four, and Chelsea just five. The Londoners also have no problems in the goal-scoring department boasting the second best strike force in the league that would be the best if not for Norwich’s capitulation in the Etihad, and Arsenal have the highest scoring midfielder in the league in Aaron Ramsey who has finally bounced back from his injury against Stoke in 2010.

Midfield and creativity is also no problem for Arsenal who boast the league’s best midfield by some distance while also having three of the league’s joint top assist makers with four each in Olivier Giroud, **Mesut Özil** and Aaron Ramsey. If in any doubt of the Gunners midfield strength all one has to do is look at the names it includes. These are Ozil, Cazorla, Ramsey, Arteta, Walcott, Podolski, Wilshere, Flamini, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Rosicky and Gnabry. There is some world-class talent there with a Gunners best starting 11 potentially leaving out a player with over 100 caps for Germany in Podolski and the highly talented Jack Wilshere.

With Wojciech Szczesny having come on leaps and bounds in the last 12 months, that leaves the Gunners only shortage of talent coming up-front where they have been forced to rely on **Olivier Giroud**, but even if he did pick up an injury, Arsenal are more than capable of playing with someone like Podolski, Walcott or Özil playing in the false-nine role. Aswell as this Arsenal acknowledge their lack of depth up-front with chief executive, Ivan Gazidis saying they will sign another striker in January.

If the Gunners sign another striker to partner Giroud, along with everything else mentioned there is no reason as to why the Premier League title won’t end up in the Emirates come May.

With Chelsea looking to break the £100m barrier in transfer signings this summer, Blues fans are no doubt excited about the prospect of multiple trophies this coming 2012/13 season.  
Eden Hazard has today been joined by his brother Thorgan from Lens, which makes him Chelsea's fourth signing and brings spending up to roughly: £70m. The Brazilian, Hulk, is reportedly the next man to sign the dotted line at Stamford Bridge in a move that would bring the London outfits tally past the one hundred million mark. In France, PSG have seemingly thrown down the gauntlet with the signings of Silva and <!--more--> Ibrahimovic and by my reckoning, if Chelsea do indeed sign Hulk from FC Porto, and Manchester City land a couple of their desired targets; summer spending across the world of football will have reached a new record high.

I could be wrong about that, but only time will tell. Early spending already has SkySports 'totaliser' at a mind boggling figure, so one can only imagine what that figure might be come September.

Back to Chelsea - the question is, even with the signings of Hazard(s), Marin, Oscar will the Blues have the firepower to nab back the Premier League, as well as impress in Europe? I don't think so.

Hazard and Oscar will need time to settle and with the departure of Drogba; it will take some time to create a rhythm between midfield and Fernando Torres, who is expected to lead the line this season. The new signings comes as quite a revamp to the squad and naturally enough, they won't set the world alight with fluid football right away.

It might not take them long to build an understanding though and if they do - Chelsea will be an extremely threatening team going forward. di Matteo, after winning the Champions League, has been trusted with the full time position and sooner, rather than later - Abramovich will be looking to have the Premier League trophy back at Stamford Bridge.

This year, personally, I cannot see it happening. While they do have the squad for a league title, and even another European trophy - it's all about time for di Matteo. In time, the Italian can lead Chelsea back to the top of the league, and even establish them as regular Champions League challengers but he needs time, backing, and freedom.

He already has one of those before a ball has been kicked in the 2012/13 season; how about the other two Roman?

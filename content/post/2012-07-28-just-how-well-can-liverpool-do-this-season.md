When Kenny Dalglish took over the reigns at Anfield after Roy Hodgson's tenure that was deemed a failure, Liverpool fans hoped that the day had come where Liverpool would reestablish themselves as Top 4 club, or even succeed that expectation.  
That didn't happen, and they went on to have a dismal season which saw one of the best players banned for a considerable chunk of the campaign following a racism scandal. Their performances on the pitch were less than desirable too. José Enrique who departed Newcastle United after claiming that NUFC would never challenge for the Top 6 with <!--more--> the current blueprint in place, summed up what a season the Reds had.

They finished below Newcastle in the table, and in one of their encounters, José Enrique was forced to fill in as goalkeeper after Pepe Reina was sent off for an alleged headbutt. NUFC won that game 2-0 thanks to a brace from a man who indirectly replaced Andy Carroll, following his £35m move to Merseyside. Ironic, much?

As they approach the 2012/13 Premier League campaign however, there's a sense of cautious optimism around Liverpool with a new manager. Their new gaffer succeed in playing very pleasing football while also churning out impressive results with Swansea, on their first Premier League season ever. Fans are hoping that Brendan Rodgers can do the very same for Liverpool.

With Fabio Borini signed already, Rodgers is trying to put his own stamp on the team and enforce his footballing mentality before the PL season begins. He has already deemed Andy Carroll pretty much surplus to requirements and is willing to take almost a £20m loss on the English international. As fate would have it, Alan Pardew is waiting in the wings to resign the former number9.

Even with Borini - who happens to be a very exciting talent and will thrive in the Premier League - just how well can Liverpool do this season? Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City, and even Arsenal will be strong candidates for the Top 4 this season again, so just how good will LFC need to be to break back in among the 'big boys'?

Remember, Spurs might not be far away from the Champions League places either, and either might Papiss Cissé and co.

Rodgers will need time and patience, something he didn't get at Reading a couple of years ago, but has since proved in Wales that with those two virtues - he can achieve impressive results.  
If he did so well with a newly promoted team in just a couple of years, one can only wonder what he is capable with Liverpool.

Can the Northern Irishman reestablish Liverpool as one of the Premier Leagues 'top dogs' once again?
